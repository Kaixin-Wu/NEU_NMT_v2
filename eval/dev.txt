er , so , going to japan should now be even more difficult . 
er , therefore , it should be more inconvenient to go to japan now . 
er , so , it will probably be more troublesome going to japan now . 
er , so now , it should be a little more difficult to go to japan . 
那么 当然 最近 日 本 呢 还是 有 一件 喜事 的 . 

well , of course , recently there has also been a piece of good news in japan . 
well , of course , there is good news in japan recently . 
of course , recently there was one good news in japan . 
well , of course , japan also had a bit of happy news recently . 
就是 日 本 的 次子 妃 纪 子 有喜了 . 

that is , princess kiko , wife of japan 's prince akishinomiya , is pregnant . 
kiko , the wife of japan 's second prince , is pregnant . 
that is , princess kiko , wife of the second son of japanese emperor , is pregnant . 
princess kiko of japan is expecting . 
这个 事情 让 很多 日本人 当然 是 期待 她 能 生 一个 男孩 继承 王位 . 

the event makes many japanese hopeful that she can give birth to a boy to succeed the throne . 
the pregnancy has led to the hope of many japanese that she will give birth to a son to inherit the throne . 
this development has caused many japanese to hope that she will give birth to a boy who will be heir to the throne . 
this matter has made many japanese naturally hope that she will bear a son to succeed to the throne . 
不过 了 呢 , 她 也 使得 一直 比较 平静 的 这个 皇室 啊 再起 波澜 . 

however , she also brought some disturbance to the otherwise quite peaceful imperial household . 
however , she has also stirred up some waves in the imperial family , which has been relatively quiet . 
but , she also threw the imperial family , which has always stayed relatively quiet , into a commotion . 
however , she has also made waves in the imperial household , which has always been relatively calm . 
呃 这个 实际上 纪 子 现在 当然 是 高龄 产妇 了 , 而且 一直 大家 以为 她 是 满足 四 口 之 家 的 . 

er , in fact kiko is now surely quite old for a pregnant woman . moreover , people have always thought she was satisfied with a four - member family . 
er , in fact , kiko is definitely an older pregnant woman . moreover , people had always believed that she was happy with a four - person household . 
uh , in fact , kiko is now of course a mature pregnant mother and she has all along been thought to be content with a family of four . 
uh , in fact , kiko of course is now a later - age expectant mother , and everyone always thought she was satisfied with her family of four . 
在 这样的 年纪 再次 怀孕 , 有 不少 人 就 不禁 要 揣测 说 , 呃 这 可能 是 在 皇室 呀 上演 了 一 幕 兄弟 之间 争 王位 的 这样的 一 桩 事件 . 

to be pregnant again at such an age , many people cannot help speculating that er , this may be a fight for the throne between brothers of the imperial household . 
for her to get pregnant again at such an age , many people cannot help but to speculate that , er , a fight for the throne between the two brothers may be unfolding in the imperial family . 
being pregnant again at such an age , many people cannot help conjecturing that , uh , a fraternal scramble for the throne may arise in the imperial household . 
with her becoming pregnant again at this age , many people could not help but guess that , uh , a struggle for the throne could be playing out between the brothers of the royal family . 
当然 这个 阴谋 论 呢 被 很多 人 津津乐道 . 

of course , this conspiracy theory has been a fascinating topic for many people . 
of course , many people take delight in talking about this conspiracy theory . 
of course , many people are taking delight in talking about this conspiracy theory . 
of course , many people are delighted to talk about this conspiracy theory . 
说 这个 事情 呢 可能 要 上述 到 几年 以前 . 

it is said that this matter may be traced back to several years ago . 
they claim that this incident may be traced back to a few years ago . 
to explain this , one must go back to a few years ago . 
to explain this matter may require going back several years . 
呃 是 这样 , 当时 呢 是 在 零二年 的 时候 呢 , 因为 就是 大 太子 德仁 , 他 的 妻子 呢 得了 这个 抑郁症 , 那么 当时 皇室 呢 就 不对 他们 报 太多 的 希望 , 就 转而 呢 向 这个 二 太子 文 仁 来 施压 . 

er , it is like this . when the wife of crown prince naruhito suffered from depression in 2002 , the imperial household placed little hope on them and turned to put pressure on prince fumihito . 
er , this is how it goes . it was in 2002 when the wife of the eldest prince naruhito was diagnosed with depression . as a result , the imperial family did not invest too much hope in them , and pressured the second eldest prince akishino in turn . 
eh , it 's like this . at that time , in 2002 , because the wife of crown prince naruhito , contracted depression , the imperial household did not place too much hope on them at the time and instead turned to the second prince , fumihito , whom they put pressure on . 
uh , it was like this : at the time , in ' 02 , because crown prince naruhito , uh , his wife , became depressed , the royal family did not hold out much hope for them at the time , so they turned to exerting pressure on prince akishino . 
那时候 , 文 仁 还 没有 太多 的 这种 回应 啊 . 

at that time , fumihito did not respond much to this . 
akishino did not have too much of a response at the time . 
at the time , fumihito did not do much in response . 
at that time , there was not much response from akishino . 
但是 到 零四年 的 时候 , 矛盾 呢 就 有一些 激化 了 , 因为 德仁 呢 呃 是 护 妻 心切 , 在 这个 公开 的 场合 呢 指责 了 王室 . 

but by 2004 , the conflict had become somewhat intense , because naruhito , eager to protect his wife , criticized the imperial household in public . 
however , in 2004 , the conflict was intensified because naruhito , er , was eager to protect his wife and um , criticized the imperial family in public . 
but , by 2004 , the contradiction intensified somewhat after naruhito , uh , out of his care for his wife , reproached the imperial family on public occasions . 
but by 2004 , the contradiction intensified somewhat , because naruhito , eager to protect his wife , blamed the royal family in public . 
那么 据说 当时 呢 这个 皇室 是 震怒 , 就 要求 和 他 平辈 的 二 太子 文 仁 呢 来 出面 反驳 他 的 哥哥 是 对 皇室 不敬 的 , 溺爱 自己的 妻子 . 

well , it is said that the imperial household at that time was furious and asked prince fumihito , who is of the same generation , to come out and accuse his elder brother of showing no respect to the imperial household while spoiling his own wife . 
well , allegedly , the imperial family was furious at that time and requested the second - eldest prince akishino , who is of the same generation as naruhito , to come forward to refute his brother , saying that his doting on his wife was a disrespect to the imperial family . 
it is said that the imperial family were furious and asked his peer , prince fumihito to stand out and rebut his elder brother , accusing him of showing disrespect for the imperial family and doting upon his wife . 
well , according to reports , the royal family was infuriated , and demanded that prince akishino , who is of the same generation , step forward to make a rebuttal , saying that his elder brother had been disrespectful to the royal family , and was doting on his wife . 
从此 呢 兄弟 不合 . 

the two brothers have not been on good terms since . 
since then , the brothers have been at odds . 
the brothers have been in discord from then on . 
from then on , there has been discord between the brothers . 
那么 现在 如果 这个 二 太子 文 仁 生下 了 一个 男孩 的话 , 那么 他们 的 这个 主轴 就 会 成为 这个 皇室 的 一个 支柱 . 

well , now if a boy is born to prince fumihito , then they , as core members , will become a pillar of the imperial household . 
now , if the second - eldest prince akishino has a boy , well , then their spindle will become a pillar of the imperial family , 
now , if prince fumihito gives birth to a boy , the dominant role they play will become a pillar of the imperial household 
so now , if , uh , prince akishino bears a son , then their , uh , main axis will become a pillar of the , uh , royal family . 
而 东宫 也就是 大 太子 那 方面 呢 肯定 会 就此 衰落 下去 . 

meanwhile , the eastern palace , that is , the elder prince , would surely decline as a result . 
while the crown prince , who is also the eldest prince , will thus decline for sure . 
and the east palace , i.e. the crown prince will surely fall out of favor . 
and that will assuredly cause a decline of the eastern palace , that is , the crown prince . 
呃 所以 有 不少 人 认为 说 , 如果 是 这样 的话 , 对 皇室 , 对 日 本 的 社会 也是 会 有 很大 的 影响 的 . 

er , so , quite a number of people think that if this is the case , it will have a great impact on the imperial household and japanese society . 
er , therefore , many people say that it will have a great impact on the imperial family and japanese society . 
eh , this is why many people say that , if things go on like this , the impact on the imperial household and the japanese society will be tremendous . 
uh , so a good many people believe that if this happens , it will have a great impact on the royal family and japanese society .

同时 他 也 说 参拜 靖 国 神社 呢 就 好比 是 歌颂 希特勒 , 而且 说 小泉 这样 做 呢 也是 使得 中韩 呢 把 日 本 呢 视为 是 一个 非常 危险 的 国家 , 这是 遗患 无穷 的 .

then , what kind of situation has been formed now ? 
so , what has the situation come to now ? 
so what kind of situation has taken shape now ? 
就是 日 本 的 第一 大报 读 卖 新闻 , 还有 日 本 的 第二 大报 就是 这个 超 朝日新闻 啊 , 现在 两 大报 已经 开始 联手 反对 小泉 参拜 靖 国 神社 了 .

原来 这 两 大报 是 打擂台 的 , 但是 后来 两 位 主席 呢 见 了 面 , 起码 在 这个 问题 上 达成 了 一致 .

这 两个人 是 谁 呢 ?

who were these two people ? 
who were the two ? 
who are these two ? 
是 一个 是 内阁 关防 长官 安倍晋三 , 另外 一个 呢 就是 最近 呀 屡屡 的 这个 有 惊人 之 语 的 日 本 的 外相 麻生太郎 .

what did the two say ? 
what did the two of them say ? 
就是说 日 本 的 这个 二战 的 战犯 呢 并不是 罪犯 .

they both said that japan 's war criminals of the second world war were not criminals . 
they said that japanese war criminals of the second world war were not criminals . 
they said that japan 's , uh , world war ii war criminals were not criminals . 
他们 的 意思 就是说 呢 , 呃 把 他们 称为 这个 罪犯 判 他们 罪 呢 这是 国际 法庭 的 意思 .

哈马斯 获得 组阁 权 后 , 外界 有人 担心 " 哈马斯 总理 " 可能 会 与 现任 最高 领导人 阿巴斯 之间 出现 分歧 . 

after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , some outsiders worried that disagreements could occur between " prime minister hamas " and current top leader abbas . 
some outsiders worry that a " hamas prime minister " might have disagreements with abbas , the current supreme leader , after hamas wins the right to organize its cabinet . 
since hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some outsiders have expressed worry that a split could take place between the " hamas prime minister " and the palestinian leader , abbas . 
after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , there have been people in the outside world who worry a ' hamas premier ' will likely see differently than the current high leader abbas . 
而且 , 正在 埃 及 访问 的 哈马斯 领导人 马沙尔 强调 由 哈马斯 领导 组建 的 巴勒斯坦 新政府 不会 承认 以色列 , 这一 强硬 信号 也 加剧 了 国际上 的 担忧 . 

in addition , hamas leader mashal , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led and formed by hamas will not recognize israel . this strong message also increased international concern . 
moreover , a hamas leader , mushir , who is visiting egypt , stressed that a new palestinian government established by hamas leadership will not acknowledge israel . this strong signal has also raised more international concerns .

also , hamas leader mashal , who is currently visiting egypt , emphasized that the new palestinian government established by hamas leaders will not continue to recognize israel . this intransigent standpoint also intensifies the worry of the international community . 
美国 和 以色列 明确 表示 不 接受 一个 掌握 实权 的 哈马斯 政府 , 并 以此 威胁 中断 对 巴勒斯坦 的 经济援助 和 向 巴方 转交 税款 . 

the us and israel explicitly said that they would not accept a hamas government which possesses actual power , threatening to discontinue economic aid and tax transfers to palestine .

然而 , 这 并不 妨碍 哈马斯 作出 灵活 的 策略 调整 , 推选 独立 人士 便是 折中 之 策 . 

however , this did not hinder hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment , selecting an independent individual as a compromise . 
however , these things do not hinder hamas from adjusting its strategy flexibly . selection of an independent candidate is one compromise . 
but this has not prevented hamas from carrying out some agile strategic adjustments , including a compromise policy of selecting independents . 
however , this has not obstructed hamas in making flexible policy adjustments - choosing independents is a policy to split the difference . 
据报道 , 为了 最大限度 获得 国际 认可 , 日前 齐 聚 埃 及 的 哈马斯 海内外 领导人 决定 推选 独立 人士 , 加沙 伊斯兰 大 学校 董事会 主席 贾迈勒 ? 胡达 里 出任 新总理 .

( sub heading ) how to allocate power 
从 内部 而言 , 哈马斯 组阁 面临 的 最大 挑战 就是 缺乏 足够的 执政 经验 . 

internally , the biggest challenge hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance . 
the biggest challenge for hamas in organizing its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient administrative experience from the perspective of its internal capabilities . 
from an internal perspective , the biggest challenge faced by the hamas - led cabinet is a lack of adequate experience in power . 
looking at the internal makeup of the party , the biggest challenge that hamas faces in forming a cabinet is it lacks ample experience being in power . 
巴勒斯坦 " 日子 报 " 载文 分析 说 , 哈马斯 通过 社会福利 项目 聚拢 了 人气 , 但 在 执政 方面 却 缺乏 经验 , 同 拥有 执政 经验 的 巴勒斯坦 民族解放运动 ( 法塔赫 ) 合作 是 上策 . 

an article carried in the palestinian newspaper al - ayyam analyzed that although hamas won popularity through its social welfare programs , it lacks experience in governance . it would be wise for it to cooperate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has experience in governance . 
an article published by the palestinian daily journal analyzed that although hamas has won support from people through social welfare items , it lacks administrative experience , and a better strategy is to collaborate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has administrative experience . 
an analysis in an article in the palestinian daily al - ayyam said that hamas gained popularity through social welfare projects but lacked experience in office . cooperation with the palestinian national liberation movement , or fatah , will be the best solution . 
the palestine " daily " published an analysis saying that while hamas gathered popularity through social welfare projects , in the area of being in power it lacks experience . hamas cooperating with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has experience being in power , would be the best strategy . 
哈马斯 在 选举 后 提出 同 法塔赫 建立 " 政治 伙伴 " 关系 , 共同 组建 民族 联合政府 , 然而 法塔赫 至今 没有 给予 积极 的 回应 . 

following the elections , hamas proposed establishing a " political partnership " with fatah so as to jointly form a national coalition government . however , fatah has not responded enthusiastically so far . 
hamas suggested to establish a " political partnership " with fatah to organize a national coalition government after the election , but fatah has not actively responded to it so far . 
after the election , hamas raise the possibility of a " political partnership " with fatah and the joint establishment of a national coalition government , but until now fatah has not given a positive response . 
hamas brought up establishing a 'government partner ' relationship with fatah after the elections to jointly establish a united ethnic government , however fatah has not given a positive response to this as of the present . 
法塔赫 内部 目前 就 是否 入阁 意见 不一 , 一派 主张 参与 新政府 , 从而 有所作为 ; 另 一派 拒绝 哈马斯 邀请 , 情愿 在 立法 委 做 个 " 积极 的 反对派 " . 

fatah is currently divided internally with regards to joining the cabinet . one faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move , while another faction rejects the hamas invitation , preferring to be an " active opposition " in the legislative council . 
inside fatah , there are now different opinions on whether it should join the cabinet ; some think it should join the new government to play a role in it ; some refuse the invitation from hamas and would rather become an " active opposition " in the legislative committee . 
fatah is internally split regarding whether to participate in the cabinet . one faction advocates taking part in the new government in order to have some sway ; another faction refuses the invitation by hamas and wants instead to be " an active opposition " in parliament . 
opinions among those in the fatah party as to whether or not to enter the cabinet are not the same . one faction advocates participating in the new government , and thus having something to say ; another faction refuses the invitation of hamas , and would rather be an 'active opposition faction ' in the legislature . 
消息灵通人士 指出 , 在 阿巴斯 的 劝说 下 , 法塔赫 逐渐 倾向 加入 新政府 . 

sources noted that under abbas 's persuasion , fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government . 
a well - informed source pointed out that fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government after abbas 's persuasion . 
informed sources say fatah , with persuasion coming from abbas , is gradually leaning toward participating in the new government . 
persons with sensitive information pointed out that under the advice of abbas , fatah is progressively leaning towards entering into the new government . 
即使 如此 , 哈马斯 与 法塔赫 也 会 就 内阁 职务 的 分配 讨价还价 . 

in spite of this , hamas and fatah will still bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions . 
even so , fatah will bargain with hamas on the allocation of cabinet positions . 
even so , hamas and fatah will still haggle over the distribution of cabinet posts . 
although this might be the case , hamas and fatah would still haggle over the allocation of cabinet positions . 
此外 , 另 一 途径 就是 组建 立法 委 框架 之外 , 脱离 党派 属性 的 内阁 . 

in addition , another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the legislative council , breaking away from partisan affiliations . 
moreover , another path is to establish a cabinet that is out of the framework of the legislative committee and free of partisan leanings . 
another path would be to establish a cabinet outside the parliamentary framework and ignore party affiliation . 
besides this , another path would be to establish a cabinet that is free of party affiliations and outside the framework of the legislature . 
据报道 , 哈马斯 也 设计 了 一个 清一色 专家 型 政府 , 但 具体 名单 不得而知 . 

according to reports , hamas has designed a government exclusively composed of experts , but the specific name list is unknown . 
as it has been reported , hamas has also designed a pure technocratic government , but the concrete name list of the government is unknown . 
according to reports , hamas has also laid out a government composed uniquely of experts , but the actual name list is still unknown . 
according to reports , hamas has also designed a technocracy government , but the concrete list of names is still unknown . 
鉴于 美国 和 以色列 的 态度 , 技术 专家 型 政府 也 不失为 一种 减轻 外部 压力 的 组阁 方式 . 

based on us and israeli attitudes , forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to relieve outside pressure . 
because of the attitude of the united states and israel , a technocratic government is a cabinet organization method that can reduce external pressure . 
in view of us and israeli attitudes , a government of technical experts is a way of forming a cabinet that will help lighten pressure from outside . 
in light of the attitude of israel and america , a technocracy government might still be accepted as a method to form a cabinet that would lessen outside pressure . 
按照 巴勒斯坦 " 基本法 " 规定 , 在 本月 16日 新 一 届 立法 委 就职 后 , 提名 总理 并 组阁 的 工作 将 在 3 周到 5 周内 完成 . 

according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , after the new legislative council assumes power on the 16th of this month , the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks . 
according to regulations of the palestinian " essential law , " nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet organization work will be completed within 3 to 5 weeks after a new legislative committee assumes office on the 16th of this month .

哈马斯 通过 民主 和 自由 的 方式 当选 立法 委 第一 大 党 得到 国际 承认 , 使 其 下属 武装 派别 " 卡 桑 旅 " 同样 合法化 的 途径 就是 将 其 统一 到 政府 的 安全 机构 中 . 

hamas won international recognition by being elected the top major party in the legislative council through democratic and free methods . the way to similarly legalize its subordinate armed faction az a - din al - qassam brigades is to integrate it into government security institutions .

新华社 东京 2月13日 电 ( 记者 钱 铮 ) 日 本 东海 大学 研究 人员 研制出 一种 生物 人造 肾 , 它 不仅 具有 和 人类 肾脏 相同 的 分解 代谢 功能 , 同时 也 具有 保留 有用 物质 成分 的 功能 , 而且 体积 小 , 易于 移植 , 随着 研究 深入 , 有望 为 肾病 患者 带来 福音 . 

xinhua news agency , tokyo , feb. 13 ( correspondent qian zheng ) researchers at japan 's tokai university have developed a type of bio - artificial kidney , which not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , but also the function of preserving useful substances . in addition it is small in size and easy to transplant . with further research , there is hope it will bring good news to kidney patients . 
xinhua news agency , tokyo , february 13 ( reporter : qian zheng ) . researchers at japan 's tokai university have developed a type of manmade biological kidney that can not only function the same as a human kidney for catabolism , but can also keep useful substances in the body . since it is small in size and easy to transplant , it is hopeful that it will bring good news to patients who have kidney disease with the further development of the study . 
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) ( reporter : qian zheng ) researchers at tokai university in japan have developed a bioartificial kidney . it not only possesses the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , but at the same time is also able to retain useful material components . additionally , it is small in size and easy to transplant . as more detailed research is carried out , there is hope that it could be good news for people with kidney disease . 
xinhua news february 13 from tokyo ( reporter qian zheng ) researchers of japan 's tokai university have developed a kind of biological artificial kidney . it not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , it also has functions to maintain useful substances . it has a small volume , is easy to transplant , and with more research there is hope it will bring good fortune to kidney disease patients . 
据 " 日 经 产业 新闻 " 日前 报道 , 新 开发 的 生物 人造 肾 主要 由 两 部分 构成 , 一部分 是 从 血液 中 过滤 代谢 废物 和 水分 的 " 人造 肾 元 " , 另 一部分 是 从 原 尿 中将 水分 和 氨基酸 等 有用 成分 重新 返回 血液 的 " 人造 尿 细管 " . 

according to a recent nikkei business daily report , the newly - developed bio - artificial kidney mainly consists of two parts , an artificial nephron that filters metabolic waste and water from the blood and an artificial renal tubule that returns to the blood the useful ingredients in primary urine , such as water and amino acids . 
as japan economic and industrial news reported a few days ago , the newly developed manmade biological kidney is composed of two parts . one is the " manmade nephron , " which filters metabolites and water in the blood ; the other is the " manmade urinary tubules , " which extract useful substances such as water and amino acids from the original urine and sends them back into the blood . 
according to a recent report by the japan light industry news , the newly developed bioartificial kidney consists primarily of two parts . one part is composed of " artificial nephrons " that filter metabolic matter and water from blood ; the other part consists of the " artificial renal tubules " the extracts water , amino acids and other useful elements from the primary urine and returns them to the blood . 
according to a report in previous days in the " nikkei business daily " , the newly developed biological artificial kidney is mainly made up of two parts . one part is the 'artificial kidney unit ' that strains out waste material and water from blood , the other part is the 'artificial urine tubes ' that returns water , amino acids and other useful materials back into the blood from crude urine . 
" 人造 肾 元 " 和 " 人造 尿 细管 " 都 由 中空 的 丝线 制成 , " 人造 尿 细管 " 的 内 侧 还 铺 满 了 具有 分解 代谢 废物 功能 的 尿 细管 上皮 细胞 . 

both the " artificial nephron " and the " artificial renal tubule " are made of hollow fibers . in addition , the interior of the artificial renal tubule is fully lined with renal tubular epithelial cells which have the ability to decompose metabolic waste . 
both the " manmade nephron " and " manmade urinary tubules " are made of hollow threads , and the internal walls of the " manmade urinary tubules " are paved with epithelial cells of urinary tubules that have the function of catabolism . 
the artificial nephrons and the artificial renal tubules are all made from hollow silk thread . the inner wall of the artificial renal tubules is also covered with a layer of tubule epithelial cells capable of breaking down waste . 
the 'artificial kidney unit ' and the 'artificial urine tubes ' are both made up of hollow fibers . the inner side of the 'artificial urine tubes ' are lined with the epithelia of urine tubes that have the function of dissimilating waste material . 
这种 上皮 细胞 能 使 多次 血液 透析 引起 的 疾病 - - " 透析 相关性 淀粉 样 变性 " 的 成因 物质 分解 为 氨基酸 并 返回 血液 , 同时 也 能 使 身体 必需 的 葡萄糖 , 维生素 和 矿物质 等 重新 进入 血液 . 

the epithelial cells can decompose the causative substance of dialysis - related amyloidosis , a disease caused by repeated hemodialysis , into amino acids and return them to the blood while reabsorbing into the blood the glucose , vitamins , and minerals the body needs . 
this type of epithelial cells can treat diseases caused by repeated hemodialysis and decompose the causative substance of " dialysis - related denatured starch " into an amino acid , and send it back into the blood . they can also send those substances necessary for the human body such as glucose , vitamins , and minerals back into the blood again . 
this kind of epithelial cell can cause the materials that lead to a disease stemming from chronic dialysis - - dialysis - related amyloidosis - - to be broken down into amino acids and then returned to the blood . at the same time , it can also cause the glucose , vitamins and minerals needed by the body to reenter the blood . 
this type of epithelia can make diseases brought about by multiple blood dialysis - such as the materials causing the formation of 'amyloid degeneration related to dialysis ' dissolve into amino acids and return to the blood , while also allowing the glucose , vitamins , minerals and other things that the body needs returned to the blood . 
而 以往 的 人造 肾 依靠 渗透压 的 差别 过滤 代谢 废物 , 不能 将 其 完全 去除 , 而且 也 不 具备 使 氨基酸 等 成分 重新 回到 血液 中 去 的 功能 . 

in contrast , previous artificial kidneys , depending on the difference of osmotic pressures to filter metabolic waste , were unable to remove that completely and nor did they have the ability to return ingredients such as amino acids to the blood . 
previous manmade kidneys depended on the osmosis pressure gap of dialysis to filter metabolites , which cannot totally get rid of them , and does not have the function of making amino acids and other substances return into the blood . 
in the past , artificial kidneys have relied on differences in osmotic pressure to filter metabolic waste but have been unable to eliminate it completely . they were also unable to return amino acids and other components to the blood . 
artificial kidneys in the past relied on the difference between permeation pressure to filter metabolized waste , and could not totally get rid of everything . they also did not have the function of returning amino acids and other materials back into the blood . 
研究 人员 利用 山羊 进行 了 生物 人造 肾 移植 实验 , 人造 肾 的 中空 丝线 内壁 使用 猪 的 上皮 细胞 . 

researchers tested the bio - artificial kidney transplant on goats , using a pig 's epithelial cells to line the interior of the hollow fibers of the artificial kidney . 
researchers used goats to do the manmade kidney transplant experiment , and the inner walls of hollow threads of the manmade kidney are lined with epithelial cells from a hog . 
the researchers conducted experimental transplants of the bioartificial kidney in goats . epithelial cells from pigs were used to make the inner wall of the hollow threads of the artificial kidney . 
researchers used a goat to carry out transplant experiments with the artificial kidney . pig epithelia was used for the hollow fibrous inner wall of the artificial kidney used .

但 他 指出 , 随着 电力 供需 形势 的 变化 以及 大量 新建 发电机组 相继 投入 运行 , 电力 安全生产 将 面临 新 的 挑战 . 

nevertheless , he noted that along with changes in the power supply and demand situation and the operation of a large number of newly - built power generator units added in succession , safe power production will face new challenges . 
but he pointed out that with changes in power supply and demand situations , and that many of the newly established generating sets are put into operation one after another , secure power production will face new challenges . 
but he also pointed out that changes in power supply and demand and the coming on line of a series of newly built power - generating systems implied new challenges for the safe production of electric power . 
however , he also pointed out that with the changes of the supply and demand trends of electricity as well as the successive bringing into service of newly built generator groups , safe electricity production will face new challenges . 
这些 挑战 包括 : 区域性 , 季节性 , 时段 性 缺 电 现象 仍将 存在 , 部分地区 电力 供需 形势 依然 偏紧 ; 由于 电 煤 价格 良性 机制 尚未 形成 , 导致 电 煤 供应 仍然 存在 较大 问题 , 同时 , 电 煤 质量 下降 的 问题 未 得到 有效 控制 , 对 发电机组 的 稳定 运行 将 产生 严重 影响 ; 部分 电网 结构 薄弱 , 设备 陈旧 , 给 系统 安全 带来 隐患 ; 电力 基建 事故 频 发 局面 尚未 得到 根本 扭转 , 形势 依然 严峻 . 

included in these challenges are : regional , seasonal , and periodic power shortages will continue to exist ; the power supply and demand situation in some regions will remain quite tight ; the lack of a good mechanism for coal pricing for power generation will continue to result in relatively big coal supply problems , while at the same time , the lack of effective control over the declining quality of coal will produce serious impact on the stable operation of power generator units ; so 
these challenges include : regional , seasonal , and time interval power shortages still exist ; power supply and demand situations in some regions are still tense ; since a good mechanism for the price of power and coal has not been formed , supply of power and coal is still quite problematic ; at the same time , the falling power and coal quality problem has not been effectively controlled , and will seriously affect stable operations of generating sets ; some power network structures are 
these challenges include the following : electricity shortages will continue to exist on a region - specific , season - specific and time - specific basis ; the supply of power remains stretched in some regions ; major problems still exist in the supply of electricity and coal because of the lack of a positive mechanism for pricing them ; at the same time , the worsening quality of coal has not yet been brought under effective control , seriously affecting the stable operation of power - generati 
these challenges include the continued existence of regional , seasonal , and time interval power shortage phenomenon because electricity supply and demand trends of some areas are still tight . the supply of electricity coal ( coal used in generating electricity ) still has rather large problems because there is no excellent electricity coal pricing mechanism . at the same time , the problem of falling quality of electricity coal has not received effective controls , seriously influenc 
史 玉波 说 , 随着 电力 体制改革 的 深入 , 许多 深层次 的 矛盾 将 不断 暴露 , 如何 保持 职工 队伍 稳定 , 保证 正常 的 生产 秩序 将 成为 面临 的 新 问题 . 

shi yubo said that with the deepening of electricity system reform , many contradictions at deep levels will continue to emerge . how to maintain a stable working staff and ensure normal production order will become new problems . 
shi yubo said that with the further development of power system reform , many deep - rooted contradictions will be continuously exposed , and how to maintain stability of employee teams and assure a normal production order will be a new issue to face . 
shi yubo said contradictions buried at deeper levels will continuously be exposed as reform permeates further into the electric power system . the new problem faced will be how to maintain stability within employee ranks and ensure normal , orderly production . 
shi yubo said that with the deepening of reforms of the electricity system , many deep rooted contradictions will continuously be revealed . the new problems will become how to maintain the stability of the workforce , and secure a normal production order .

wang ziqiang said that according to the provisions of the current law , as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use , newspapers and magazines can use works already published in newspapers and magazines without the consent of authors while paying compensation . the national copyright administration has specifically set forth the compensation standards for republishing by newspapers and magazines in accordance with the provisions of the law . 
wang ziqiang said that according to existing laws and regulations , regarding those works published in newspapers , as long as their authors did not state that " they cannot be used , " newspapers can use those works without their authors ' permission , but at the same time should pay them , and the state copyright bureau has made the payment standard specifically for newspaper reprint practices according to the law . 
wang ziqiang said that according to the laws and regulations currently in effect , works already published in a newspaper or magazine , if an author fails to make a " not for use " declaration , magazines and newspapers can use the work without the author 's permission but at the same time be required to pay remuneration . in accordance with the provisions of rules and regulations , the state copyright bureau has specially formulated remuneration standards for retransmission of newspapers

" however , newspapers and periodicals must pay compensation for works republished . the national copyright administration has set the standards for compensation for reproduced works of newspapers and 
但是 , 按照 现行 法律 规定 , 报刊 社 享有 这种 法定 许可 的 权利 , 目前 互联网 不 享有 这种 法定 许可 的 权利 . 

however , according to the provisions of the current law , newspaper and magazine publishers have this legal right while no such legal permission is given to the internet at this time . 
however , according to regulations in existing laws , newspapers have the right to such legal permissions , but the internet currently does not have rights for such legal permissions . 
however , according to the laws and regulations currently in effect , while newspapers and magazine have the legal right to require authorization , internet sites do not have the same right . 
however , according to the regulations of laws currently in effect , newspaper and periodical agencies enjoy the rights of this statutory license , but at present the internet does not enjoy these rights . 
根据 最高人民法院 作出 的 相关 司法 解释 , 报刊 转载 法定 许可 的 这种 使用 方式 可以 适用于 互联网 , 即 报刊 , 互联网 上 发表 的 短小 文章 , 作者 没有 作出 " 不得 使用 " 声明 的 , 互联网 可以 不 经过 许可 使用 , 同时 要 支付 报酬 . 

according to the relevant legal interpretation given by the supreme people 's court , the legal permission to republish given to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the internet , that is , as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use , small articles published in newspapers , magazines , and on the internet can be used online without permission while compensations are made . 
according to related interpretations made by the people 's supreme court , the legal permission for newspaper reprints is applied to the internet , i.e. to any small or short articles published in newspapers or on the internet , whose authors did not state that " they cannot be used , " the internet can use them without permission , but at the same time needs to pay their authors . 
according to a related judicial interpretation by the supreme people 's court , the method in which the legal right to require authorization is applied to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the internet , so that short articles published in newspapers , magazines and on the internet can be used on the internet without acquiring permission if the author has not made a " do not use " declaration , with the user being required to pay remuneration . 
according to relevant judicial interpretation by the supreme people 's court , statutory license for reproduction of newspaper and periodical works can be suitably used for the internet . short articles published on newspapers , periodicals , and the internet can be used by internet sites without obtaining approval while also paying compensation as long as the author does not declare works " cannot be used . " 
但 由于 司法 解释 对 报酬 标准 没有 规定 , 所以 在 实际 当中 互联网 使用 这些 作品 的 时候 并 没有 付出 报酬 . 

however , since the legal interpretation does not stipulate the compensation standards , in reality such works are used on the internet without being given any compensations . 
but because the legal interpretation does not determine the payment standard , the internet has not made payments when it used those works in practice . 
but because the judicial interpretation does not make any stipulations regarding remuneration standards , in practice no remuneration is being paid when these works are used on the internet . 
however , because the legal interpretation has no stipulations as to the standard of compensation , in reality when internet sites have used these works , they have not paid compensation . 
" 关于 互联网 使用 这些 已 发表 的 短小 作品 是不是 适用 法定 许可 , 还需要 从 法律 的 层面 来 确定 . " 

" whether the legal permission is applicable to these published short works used on the internet still needs to be confirmed legally . " 
" regarding whether the internet use of published small or short works applies to the legal permission , it still needs to be determined according to the laws . " 
" on the issue of whether legal authorization applies to the use on the internet of short articles that have already been published , this still needs to be determined at the legal level . " 
" concerning whether the internet 's use of these already published short articles is suitable use of statutory license or not , this still must be confirmed from the view point of the law . " 
王自强 说 : " 是否 把 它 纳入 法律 确定 的 范围 , 还 有待 今年 出台 的 这个 信息 网络 传播 权 保护 条例 加以 确认 . " 

wang ziqiang said : " whether it will be included into the scope set forth by the law still needs to be confirmed by the information network publishing rights protection rules to be issued this year . "

尽管 意大利 三令五申 说 , 都灵 冬奥会 期间 被 查出 使用 兴奋剂 的 运动员 都 可能 面临 " 牢狱 之 灾 " , 但 目前 从 种种 情况 来看 , 这种 情形 不太 可能 发生 在 本届 冬奥会 首例 兴奋剂 丑闻 的 主角 - - 俄罗斯 冬季 两 项 运动员 奥 ? 派 列 娃 身上 . 

although italy has said repeatedly that all athletes found using stimulants during the turin winter olympics may face " prison sentences , " based on various circumstances at this time , such fate is unlikely to happen to russian biathlete olga pyleva , the center of the first stimulant scandal at this winter olympics . 
although italy reiterated that any athletes who are discovered using stimulants may face the " disaster of being jailed , " many cases currently demonstrate that it is unlikely to happen to russian women 's biathlon athlete olga pyleva , who is at the center of the first scandal over stimulant use at the winter olympic games . 
italy has reiterated on several occasions that all athletes found doping during the turin winter olympics could face a " prison term " , but judging from things as they stand now , chances are slim that this will happen to russian biathlete olga pyleva , leading figure in the first doping scandal of these winter olympics . 
although italy repeatedly issued orders saying that all athletes discovered using stimulants during the turin olympics would likely face " the specter of jail ; " however , looking at various circumstances it seems that the main character in the first stimulant scandal of this winter olympics , russian biathlon athlete olga pyleva , will not likely face jail - time . 
都灵 冬奥会 16日 爆出 开幕 以来 的 首例 兴奋剂 丑闻 , 奥 ? 派 列 娃 被 查出 使用 了 违禁 药物 卡 非 多 . 

on the 16th , the first stimulant scandal broke out at the turin winter olympics when olga pyleva was found to have used carphedon , a banned drug . 
the first stimulant use scandal at the turin winter olympic games was exposed on the 16th , and olga pyleva was discovered to have used the illegal and banned drug carphedon .

翌日 , 国际 奥委会 宣布 , 派 列 娃 已 被 逐出 冬奥会 , 她 在 本届 冬奥会 上 获得 的 冬季 两 项 女子 15 公里 个人赛 银牌 也 已 被 剥夺 . 

the next day the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had been expelled from the winter olympics . in addition , she was stripped of the individual biathlon silver medal for women 's 15 km event she won at this winter olympics .

the next day , the international olympic committee announced that pyleva had already been expelled from the winter olympics , and the gold medal she won in the women 's biathlon 15 km individual race at this winter olympics had already been stripped from her .

on the same day , the international biathlon union decided to give pyleva a two - year ban from the competition . 
the same day , the international winter biathlon alliance determined to forbid pyleva to participate in the sport for two years . 
the same day , the international winter biathlon union decided to ban her from competition for two years .

一直 以来 , 国际 奥委会 规定 , 运动员 在 奥运会 上 被 查出 使用 兴奋剂 , 将 被 取消 成绩 并 被 剥夺 参赛 资格 , 但 不受 法律制裁 . 

it has always been the ioc regulation that athletes found using stimulants at the olympic games be subject to revocation of their achievements and the eligibility to compete , but they are not subject to legal sanctions . 
the international olympic committee has been implementing the regulation that once athletes are discovered using stimulants , they will lose their qualification to participate in the games , and the scores they achieved will be withdrawn , but they are not subject to legal punishment . 
it has been a consistent rule of the international olympic committee that any athlete found to have used performance - enhancing drugs at an olympics games will have his or her result cancelled and be disqualified from participation , but will receive no legal penalty . 
it has always been that the international olympic committee stipulated that athletes discovered using stimulants at the olympic games would have their scores cancelled and have their qualifications for taking part in events taken away , but they would not receive the punishment of the law . 
然而 , 依照 意大利 法律 , 运动员 携带 和 使用 兴奋剂 属于 犯罪行为 , 司法 机构 有权 直接 逮捕 和 调查 使用 兴奋剂 的 运动员 , 以身试法 者 还 面临 3 个月 至 3 年 时间 不等 的 监禁 . 

however , under italian law , athletes ' carrying and using stimulants are considered criminal acts . prosecution agencies have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes on stimulants , and violators also face a prison sentence of between three months and three years . 
however , according to italian law , the carrying and use of stimulants by any athlete are criminal activities . a law enforcement organization has the right to directly arrest and investigate any athlete who uses stimulants . any violators of the law are subject to jail for 3 months to 3 years . 
but under italian law , athletes commit a crime by carrying and using stimulants . judicial authorities have the power to directly arrest and investigate all athletes that use performance - enhancing drugs and punish violators with prison terms ranging from three months to three years .

去年12月 , 国际 奥委会 和 意大利 政府 经过 长达 一 年 的 " 讨价还价 " 后 终于 达成 协议 , 双方 同意 在 本届 冬奥会 期间 依照 意大利 法律 来 处理 运动员 使用 兴奋剂 事件 . 

in december last year , after " bargaining " for a year , the ioc and the italian government finally reached an agreement , under which the two sides will deal with cases of athletes using stimulants at this winter olympics in accordance with the italian law . 
the international olympic committee had been " bargaining " with the italian government for one year , and eventually reached an agreement last december . both sides agreed that during the period of the winter olympic games , any athletes who use stimulants would be handled according to italian laws .

last december , the international olympic committee and the italian government concluded " negotiations " that had lasted as long as a year , finally reaching an agreement that both sides would deal with athletes using stimulants according to italian law at this winter olympics . 
经过 国际 奥委会 的 不懈 努力 , 意大利 方面 在 冬奥会 开幕 前四天 作出 让步 , 承诺 冬奥会 期间 警方 不会 进入 奥运村 搜查 运动员 驻地 , 但是 , 药检 呈阳性 的 运动员 仍将 接受 意大利 检察 机关 的 调查 . 

through the untiring efforts of the ioc , the italian side made concession four days before the winter olympics opened , promising that police would not enter the olympic village to raid athletes ' quarters during the winter olympics , but athletes tested positive for drugs are still subject to investigations of italian prosecutors . 
through the unremitting efforts made by the international olympic committee , the italian side made a compromise four days before the opening ceremonies of the winter olympic games , and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search athlete residences during the olympic games . but any athletes whose drug tests show positive will be investigated by italian prosecution organizations .

有 报道说 , 意大利 政府 监督 都灵 冬奥会 的 官员 佩斯坎特 已经 将 派 列 娃 的 兴奋剂 事件 移交给 都灵 检察 机关 . 

some reports said that pescante , an italian government official supervising the turin winter olympics , has already turned over the case of pyleva using stimulant to turin 's prosecutors .

however , the international olympic committee and pescante have not confirmed this as of present . 
俄罗斯 冬季 两 项 队 队医 安 ? 德 米托夫 17日 中午 透露 , 派 列 娃 已经 离开 都灵 , 返回 国内 . 

russian biathlon team doctor andrey dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that pyleva has already left turin for her country . 
andrey dmytriev , a doctor for the russian biathlon team , disclosed at noontime on the 17th that pyleva had left turin and returned home .

russian team doctor for the biathlon team andrey dmytriev revealed on february 17 that pyleva had already left turin and returned to russia . 
曾 在 世界 反 兴奋剂 机构 任职 多年 的 中国 体育 官员 史 康成 认为 , 一旦 派 列 娃 返回 国内 , 这件事 情 最终 有可能 就 " 不了了之 " . 

shi kangcheng , a chinese sports official who formerly worked at the world anti - doping agency for many years , thinks that once pyleva returns to her country , this incident may eventually " end where it is . " 
shi kangcheng , a chinese sports official who had been in a position at the world anti - stimulant organization for many years , thinks that once pyleva returns home , this case might eventually " be settled by leaving it unsettled . " 
shi kangcheng , a chinese sports official who worked for years in the world anti - doping agency , said that once pyleva returned home the case would very likely end up unsettled . 
chinese sports official shi liancheng , who worked for many years at the world anti - stimulant organization , believes that as soon as pyleva returns to russia , this incident 's ending will likely be " inconclusive . " 
史 康成 说 , 国际 奥委会 和 意大利 政府 在 冬奥会 反 兴奋剂 问题 上 一直 就 没有 " 彻底 解决 " , 即使 意大利 检察 机关 果真 介入 此事 , 结果 也 很难说 . 

shi kangcheng said that the ioc and the italian government have never " thoroughly resolved " the anti - stimulant issue at the winter olympics . even if the italian prosecution agency really gets involved in this case , the outcome is still hard to tell . 
shi kangcheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have not " completely addressed " the anti - stimulant issue at the winter olympic games , and it is hard to say what the outcome would be even if italian prosecution organizations really did get involved in the case . 
shi kangcheng added that the international olympic committee and the italian government had never been " thorough " in their anti - doping drive at the winter olympics and the outcome would be hard to predict even if italian prosecutors did step in . 
shi liancheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have never " thoroughly resolved " the anti - stimulant problems at the winter olympics , and although the italian investigating authorities have indeed come into play , the results are hard to predict . 
根据 以往 意大利 对 本国 运动员 使用 兴奋剂 事件 的 判罚 案例 来看 , 违禁 者 得到 的 最重 惩罚 也 不过是 " 两年 监禁 缓期 执行 " . 

based on italy 's penalties on its own athletes in the previous cases of stimulant abuse , the maximum penalties violators got were only " two - year deferred imprisonment . " 
based on past penalty cases in which italy sentenced or punished its own athletes who used stimulants , the most serious penalty was merely a " two - year probation . " 
based on past instances of punishment handed down to italian athletes that have used performance - enhancing drugs , the harshest punishment imposed on violators was no more than " two years of prison term served on probation " . 
looking at the punishments in judgment of cases of domestic athletes using stimulants in italy , the most serious punishments that offenders have received is no more than " two years of suspended imprisonment . " 
因此 , 意大利 安莎社 资深 记者 皮埃里 表示 , 派 列 娃 进 监狱 的 可能性 " 微乎其微 " , 顶多 也就是 罚款 . 

therefore , piaili , a senior reporter from the italian news agency ansa , said that there is " little " chance that pyleva will go to jail . she would just face fines at maximum . 
thus , senior reporter piali from the italian ansa said that the possibility of pyleva being jailed is " very small , " and at most , she might be fined . 
for this reason , senior reporter of italy 's ansa [ pei ai ] predicted that the possibility of pyleva going to prison was " exceedingly slim " and that a fine would be the most she would receive . 
therefore , senior reporter pieri of italy 's ansa news expressed that the likelihood of pyleva going to prison is " extremely small , " and at most a fine will be given . 
皮埃里 还 表示 , 虽然 意大利 法庭 可以 进行 缺席 审判 , 但 意大利 警方 也 不可能 到 国外 把 派 列 娃 抓回来 服刑 . 

piaili also said that although the italian court can hold a trial in absentia , the italian police will not be able to go abroad to catch pyleva and bring her back for serving the sentence . 
piali also said that although an italian court could sentence her by default , it is impossible for the italian police to catch pyleva abroad and bring her back to serve the sentence . 
also said that although an italian court can pass judgment in absentia , it would be impossible for the italian police to bring her back from a foreign country for a prison term . 
pieri expressed that although italian courts can carry out sentencing without the accused present , italian police are not likely to go abroad to bring pyleva back for punishment . 
如果 派 列 娃 拒不 接受 判决 , 意大利 方面 也 拿 她 没有 办法 . 

if pyleva refuses to accept the judgment , the italian side will not be able to do anything to her . 
if pyleva refuses to accept the sentence , the italian side can do nothing about it . 
if pyleva refused to accept a judgment , there would be no way italian authorities could detain her . 
if pyleva refuses to accept the judgment , then italy will have no way to get her .

based on an analysis of their strengths , taishan has a very good chance to become champion , but it is by no means a sure thing . 
according to analysis of their strength , although the luneng team has great hope of winning the championship , it does not have 100% assurance . 
首先 , 新 球员 磨合 时间 短 

first , new team members have little time to get adjusted . 
first , the time for new team members to adapt to each other is short . 
first of all , the new team members have not had long enough to get worked in . 
first of all , the new players only have a short time to train and be broken in . 
泰山队 去年 四大皆空 , 

the taishan team had four major openings last year . 
the taishan team had nothing new last year . 
taishan lost at four major events last year . 
last year luneng came home empty from the four big games . 
今年 泰山队 引进 了 李雷 雷 和 王亮 两 名 国脚 , 不久 之后 , 还将 有 两 名 外援 加盟 , 实力 应 说是 有增无减 . 

this year , following recruitment of the two famous national football players li leilei and wang liang , the taishan team will soon be joined by two foreign players . its strength should be said to have increased without decreasing . 
the taishan team introduced li leilei and wang liang , the two members from the national team , this year . soon after that , it will also add two members to the team from foreign teams , and its actual strength should be seen as increased , not reduced . 
this year , taishan recruited two players from the national team - - li leilei and wang liang . with the addition of two foreign players soon afterwards , it is safe to say that the team will be stronger . 
this year luneng has brought in two famous national players , li leilei and wang liang , and soon there will be two foreign players that will join the ranks as well . the team 's power can be said to have had increases and no decreases . 
但是 由于 国家队 备战 与 巴勒斯坦 和 伊拉克 的 比赛 , 国脚 们 与 队友 的 配合 还 谈不上 , 

however , since the national team is preparing for matches with palestine and iraq , there has hardly been any coordination between the national team players and their teammates . 
but because the national team is preparing for the matches with the palestinian and iraqi teams , those members of the national team cannot coordinate with the members of this team . 
but because the national football team is preparing for matches with palestine and iraq , there no way to say how well the two players from the national team will integrate . 
however , because the national team must prepare for competitions with pakistan and iraq , the national players won 't be able to practice with their team mates . 
待 他们 回到 俱乐部 时 , 联赛 就要 打 了 , 

by the time they return to the team , the super league will be starting . 
when they return to the football club , the league matches will start right away , 
by the time they return to the club , league matches will be set to begin . 
when they finally return to their club , the tournament will begin shortly ; 
所以 磨合 问题 成了 泰山队 面临 最大 的 问题 . 

therefore , the problem of getting adjusted is the biggest problem the taishan team now faces . 
so , the issue of adapting to each other is the biggest issue the taishan team is facing . 
that is why integration has become the most significant issue taishan is facing . 
thus the breaking in and integration of new players is the biggest problem faced by luneng . 
我 觉得 , 在 联赛 的 前 几 轮 可以 让 国脚 们 先 打打 替补 , 

in my opinion , the national football players can serve as substitutes in the first few super league matches . 
i think that those members from the national team can be substitute players for the first several rounds of games in the league matches . 
in my view , the national - team players can be used as backups in the first few rounds of league matches . 
i think that in the first few rounds of the tournament they should let the national players play second string . 
一来 可以 趁 比赛中 的 训练 磨合 队伍 , 

first , the games can be used as practice to get the team adjusted . 
firstly , they can be trained to adapt to the team in matches ; 
first , team integration can be achieved using the in - game training . 
firstly they can use the competitions to break in and integrate the ranks , 
二来 可以 让 打完 两 场 国家队 小组赛 的 球员 休息 一下 , 

second , it can allow the players who have just finished two group matches with the national team to take a rest . 
secondly , those national team members who have played two group matches can have a rest . 
second , the national - team players who have just played group matches with the national team can use the lull to rest up . 
and secondly they can allow these players who played in two national group competitions to rest a bit . 
几 轮 之后 , 刀 磨 好了 , 在 上 也 不迟 . 

after sharpening their skills in several matches , it will not be too late to enter the battle . 
after several rounds of matches , their edge would be honed , and it won 't be too late for them to participate . 
after a few rounds , when the " knife is well sharpened ' , it will not be too late for them to play top spots . 
after a few rounds , when the 'knives ' are broken in , it will not be too late for them to come into play . 
其次 , 防守 存在 隐患 

the next problem is the hidden troubles on defense . 
second , its defense has hidden problems . 
in addition , the defense has some weaknesses . 
also , the team has hidden trouble with its defense . 
在 去年 , 泰山队 的 防守 就 被 球迷 所 诟病 , 

last year , the taishan team 's defense was criticized by football fans . 
the defense of the taishan team was scolded as a sick one by its fans last year . 
last year , taishan 's fans had some unfavorable things to say about the team 's defense . 
in the past , luneng 's defense has been denounced by fans , 
今年 , 引进 了 李雷 雷 , 防守 有所 改善 , 但 还 未 到 高枕无忧 的 时候 , 

this year , defense has been improved somewhat with the recruitment of li leilei , but it 's not yet time to rest easy . 
li leilei was introduced this year , and has improved the defense , but the team has not reached the time for sitting back and relaxing . 
this year , the defense will have improved with the recruitment of li leilei . but it 's still not the time to sit back and relax . 
this year , with the addition of li leilei , the team 's defense has improved but is far from being foolproof . 
中 后卫 转身 慢 的 问题 依旧 存在 , 而 替补 球员 不是 年龄 偏 大 , 就是 经验 欠缺 , 

the central back still has a problem with turning around slowly , while the substitute players are either slightly old or lack sufficient experience . 
the problem of center halfbacks ' and fullbacks ' slowness in turning back still exists , and those substitute players are either older in age or lack experience . 
there 's still the problem of sluggish turnaround at the center back position , and the substitutes for this position are either too old or lacking in experience . 
the problem of middle rear guards being slow at turning around the ball still exists , and second string players are either too old or lack experience . 
如果 中 后卫 今年 的 发挥 能够 稳定 的话 , 那 泰山队 的 夺冠 道路 上 又 加 了 一块 砝码 . 

if the central back can put forth a stable performance this year , then the taishan team will have a greater chance of winning the championship . 
if center halfbacks and fullbacks can solidly play their roles , the taishan team would have one more advantage in its path to seizing the championship . 
if performance at the center back position can be stabilized , taishan will gain some momentum on the road to becoming champion . 
if middle rear guards are stable in their abilities this year , then another step will be taken toward luneng 's road to the championship . 
我 认为 , 不妨 用 身体素质 好的 任 永 顺 , 虽然 经验 不足 , 但 可以 在 今年 锻炼 一下 , 为 今后 作准备 , 

i think it may be a good idea to use ren yongshun , who is in good physical shape . despite insufficient experience , he can test himself this year and prepare for the future . 
i think that it does not hurt to use ren yongshun who has good physical qualities , although lacking experience . he can exercise this year in preparation for the future . 
in my opinion , they might as well use ren yongshun , who is strong physically . although he lacks experience , he should be put to work this year so as to be ready in the future . 
i believe that the team should use ren yongshun , whose physical condition is good . although he lacks experience , he can train this year , and prepare for the present and future . 
另外 , 高尧 撤回 打 拖 后 也 行 

in addition , it is also fine to recall gao yao to play sweeper . 
and also , it is ok to withdraw gao rao to play fullback . 
in addition , gao yao can play center back as well . 
besides this , gao yao is good at playing both forward and rear positions . 
泰山队 能 打 后腰 的 人 不少 , 崔鹏 , 海滨 , 都 能 打 . 

there are quite a few members of the taishan team who can play defensive midfield . both cui peng and haibin can play . 
many members of the taishan team can play fullback , including cui peng and hai bin . 
taishan has quite a few players who can play defending midfield , such as cui peng and hai bing . 
luneng has many players that can play center field , cui peng and hai bin can play this position . 
高尧 身体 强壮 , 抢 断 凶狠 , 在 中 后卫 位置 上 , 应该 能够 胜任 . 

gao yao , who is physically strong and fierce in intercepting the ball , should be able to do a good job as central back . 
gao rao is strong physically , and can aggressively and fiercely intercept the ball , and should be able to do a good job in the position of either center halfback or fullback . 
gao yao is physically very strong and a ferocious interceptor . he should be able to handle the center back position . 
gao yao 's body is strong , he 's good at stealing the ball , and in the position of middle rear guard he should be able to do a good job . 
再次 , 外援 是否 适应 

also , whether the foreign players can adjust themselves ... 
third , whether foreign players can adapt to the team . 
another question is whether the foreign recruits can adjust . 
once again , if the foreign players will be suitable or not is a problem . 
外援 问题 一直 是 困扰 泰山队 的 大 问题 , 

issues with foreign players have constantly been a big problem for the taishan team . 
the introduction of foreign players is a big issue that has been puzzling the taishan team . 
taishan has been plagued by problems with foreign recruits . 
foreign players are a big problem that has always complicated luneng . 
去年 , 丹 丘 的 发挥 让 人 不敢 恭维 , 

last year , danciulescu 's performance left much to be desired . 
nobody dares to say anything good about dan qiu 's performance last year . 
the performance of daniel [ daniel danciulescu ] last year was far from stellar . 
last year , the unleashing of ionel danciulescu left many unimpressed , 
今年 的 外援 知道 现在 还 没有 选定 . 

i know the foreign players for this year have not been determined yet . 
it is known that foreign players have not been selected for introduction for this year . 
we know that this year 's selection of foreign players has not yet been finalized . 
and selections for this year 's foreign players have still not been made . 
我 觉得 , 今年 除了 引进 一名 出色 的 前锋 以外 , 还 应该 引进 一名 纯粹 的 左脚 前卫 , 

i think that this year , in addition to recruiting an excellent striker , a pure left midfielder should be recruited . 
i think that in addition to introduction of an outstanding forward , a very good left - foot forward should be introduced too . 
i think that apart from bringing in an excellent striker , a true left - footed midfielder should also be recruited this year . 
i think that this year , besides bringing in a extraordinary forward , they should also bring in a pure left forward guard , 
泰山队 除了 前几年 的 邢锐 , 还 没有 一名 真正 的 左脚 匠 , 

except for xing rui a few years ago , the taishan team has not had a single true left - footed specialist . 
except xing rui , who played on the taishan team several years ago , there has not been a real left - foot player on the team . 
except for xing rui , who played for the team a few years ago , taishan has not had a true left - footed player with good skills . 
except for xing rui from several years ago , luneng doesn 't have a left footer in the true meaning . 
虽然 崔鹏 等人 均可 胜任 , 但 一名 真正 的 左前卫 还是 比 客串 的 要好 的 多 . 

although cui peng and others are all competent , however , a real left midfielder is still much better than a stand - in . 
although some players like cui peng can play the role , a real left - foot forward would be much better than one who is a guest player . 
although players like cui peng and other can play the position , a truly competent left half back would be greatly preferred to fill - in . 
although cui peng and other can live up to the position , a true left forward guard would be much better than guest players . 
这 三 个 问题 如 能 解决好 , 泰山队 的 争 冠 之路 应该 会 平坦 一些 , 

if these three problems can be resolved well , the road to the championship for the taishan team should be a bit smoother . 
if these three issues can be solved well , the path for the taishan team to seize the championship should be somewhat smoother . 
if these three issues can be solved , taishan 's road to the championship should be somewhat smoother . 
if these three problems are resolved , luneng 's road to gain the championship should be more even . 
作为 山东 球迷 , 相当 希望 泰山队 今年 能 夺取 冠军 , 

as a shandong football fan , i hope very much that the taishan team will win the championship this year . 
as a shandong football fan , i really hope that the taishan team will be able to seize the championship this year . 
as a shandong football fan , i 'm really hoping taishan can win the championship this year . 
as a luneng fan , i hope that luneng wins the championship this year , 
但 平心而论 , 今年 夺冠 形式 , 泰山队 希望 很大 但 把握 不大 . 

however , to be honest , based on this year 's competitive situation , the taishan team has great hopes but there are few assurances . 
but frankly speaking , the taishan team is very hopeful , but has no full guarantee of winning the championship this year . 
but to be frank , with things looking like they do in the championships this year , taishan has a good chance , but it is far from a sure thing . 
however , to tell the truth , the shape of this year 's championship has luneng with great hopes but no great assurances .

大概 知道 他 以前 在 新 浪 , 后来 自己 创业 , 搞 了 一个 类似于 国外 adbrite.com 的 中小企业 互联网 广告 交换 平台 , 

i roughly know that he used to be at sina and later started his own business , an internet ad exchange platform for small and medium - sized businesses , similar to adbrite.com abroad . 
you probably know that he was at sina.com , and later he himself created a business , and established an internet advertisement exchange platform for small and medium - size enterprises , similar to adbrite.com abroad . 
you probably know that he was previously with sina . he later started his own business , setting up an internet advertisement exchange platform for smes that was similar to the overseas website adbrite.com . 
you probably know that before he was at sina , he established a business himself , making a small - and medium - enterprise internet advertisement exchange platform similar to the foreign adbrite.com . 
那时 和 他 在 MSN 上 辩论 过 , 大概 的 意思 是 说 : 几何 觉得 中国 很多 行业 的 发展 都 依赖 于 私营 经济 和 中小企业 的 壮大 , 

at that time he debated on msn to the effect that vista thinks that the development of many sectors in china all depends on private economy and growth of small and medium - sized businesses . 
he debated on msn at that time . his rough idea is that : geometry feels that the development of many of china 's industries depends on the strength of private economy and small and medium - size enterprises .

but in china 's present market , this situation cannot make people optimistic .

所以 创意 行业 和 类似 的 服务 中小企业 的 咨询 都 无法 形成规模 , 

therefore , the creative media sector and the similar consulting sector serving small and medium - sized businesses are unable to grow into large scale . 
so , intellectual trades , similar services , and consultation of small and medium - size enterprises cannot form sizable ones . 
so sme 's in creative industries and similar services are unable to provide consultation to any significant extent . 
thus creative industries and similar consultative agencies in service of small and medium enterprises have no way to take shape in any scope , 
收取 较高 费用 来 促成 自身 发展 , 最终 导致 一个 并不 乐观 的 循环 . 

charging higher fees to facilitate its own development eventually led to an unfulfilling cycle . 
collection of higher fees for their own development will eventually bring a pessimistic cycle . 
collecting high fees to advance one 's own development in the end leads to a discouraging cycle . 
and demand a relatively high fee to facilitate self development , finally leading to a recurring cycle that is not encouraging .

two days ago , a friend said , i have already no time to take care of myself . even if i want to help others , i will not have the energy to do it . 
some friend said a couple of days ago that he has no time to take care of himself , not mention to help people , even though his desire for providing help is bigger than his ability . 
a couple days ago a friend said , " i already have no spare time to take care of myself . as for helping people , the heart is there by the means are not . " 
in the last few days i 've had friends say , i already have no time to care for myself ; in helping people , my heart is full of vigor but by my strength lacking . 
祝 一天 愉快 : ) 

wish you a pleasant day : ) 
wish you a happy day : )

十年 前 的 妈妈 

mom ten years ago 
mom of ten years ago 
a mother ten years in the past 
mother of ten years ago 
那是 在 十年 前 的 一天 , 当 这位 老师 正 利用 中午 休息 时间 , 在 家里 睡觉 时 , 突然间 , 电话 铃 响了 , 

on that day ten years ago , when this teacher was taking a nap at home during noontime break , the telephone rang suddenly . 
it was one day ten years ago when this teacher was taking a nap by using the rest time at noon . suddenly , the phone rang . 
it was a day ten years ago . the teacher was using the lunch break to nap at home , when suddenly the telephone rang . 
it was one day ten years ago when this teacher was using the noon rest time to sleep at her home ; suddenly the telephone rang . 
她 接过来 一 听 , 里面 却 传出 一个 陌生 粗暴 的 声音 : & quot ; 你 家 的 小孩 偷 书 , 现在 被 我们 抓住 了 , 你 快 来 啊 ! & quot ; 

she picked up the phone and listened , yet out came a strange rough voice : " we have caught your kid stealing a book . come here quick ! " 
she picked up the phone , and heard a strange and rude voice : " your child stole a book , and we caught her . come and hurry up ! " 
she answered and heard an unfamiliar rough voice from the receiver : " your child stole a book and we caught her . come over right away ! " 
she received the call and listened , and out came a strange and rough sound : " your child was stealing books and now she 's been caught by us , come quickly ! " 
在 话筒 里 还 传出 一个 小 女孩 的 哭 闹 声 , 和 旁边 人 的 喝叱 声 . 

coming from the other end of the line was a little girl 's crying , along with loud scolding voices of others . 
the crying noise of a little girl and denouncing voices from others came out of the handset . 
the crying of a little girl could also be heard though the receiver , as well as the sound of somebody nearby scolding her . 
from out of the receiver also came the noise of a young girl crying , and the sounds of chiding from people surrounding the young girl . 
她 回头 眺望 着 一边 正在 看 电视 的 唯一 女儿 , 心中 立即 就 明白 过来 . 

glancing over at her only daughter , who was watching tv nearby , it suddenly dawned upon her . 
she understood the thing immediately when she turned her head and looked at her only daughter , who was watching tv . 
she turned her head to look at her only daughter watching the television and then immediately understood what was happening . 
she looked over at her only daughter who was watching tv , and she immediately understood . 
肯定 是 有 一位 小 女孩 , 因为 偷 书 被 售货员 抓住 了 , 而又 不肯 让 家里人 知道 , 所以 , 胡编 了 一个 电话号码 , 才 碰巧 打 到这里 . 

obviously , a little girl must have got caught by the sales person while she was stealing a book . as she did not want to let her family know it , she must have made up a phone number at random . that was how they happened to call here . 
there must be a little girl who was caught by the saleswoman for stealing a book . she does not want her family members to know this , so she made up a phone number , and a phone call happens to come here . 
clearly , a little girl had been caught by a store clerk stealing a book and did not want her family to find out , so she dialed a number at random and happened to call there . 
it was definitely a young girl who was caught by the salesperson stealing books , but was not willing to allow her family to learn of this ; thus , she made up a phone number , and by coincidence it rung at the teacher 's home . 
她 当然 可以 放下 电话 不理 , 甚至 也 可以 斥责 对方 , 

of course she could put down the phone and ignored the call . she could also even reprimand the other party , 
she could of course hang up the phone and give no response , and even scold the other side . 
of course , she could hang up and forget about it , or even reprimand the party on the other line , 
of course the teacher could put down the phone and take no notice of this - - she could even rebuke the person on the receiving end , 
因为 这件事 , 和 她 没有 任何 关系 . 

because this incident had nothing to do with her . 
because this thing has nothing to do with her . 
because this affair had absolutely nothing to do with her . 
because this event had no connection to her whatsoever . 
但 自己 是 老师 , 说不定 她 就是 自己的 学生 呢 

however , being a teacher , she thought she might be her own student . 
but she herself is a teacher ; maybe that girl is one of her pupils . 
but she was a teacher , and it could be that it was one of her students . 
but she was a teacher , and maybe the girl was her student 
透过 电话 , 她 隐约 可以 设想出 , 那个 一念之差 的 小 女孩 , 一定 非常 惊慌 害怕 , 正 面临 着 也许 是 人生 中 最 可怕 的 境地 . 

the phone call gave her some rough idea that the little girl , who made the momentary slip , must be very much frightened and was facing perhaps the most horrifying situation in her life . 
she could probably imagine through the phone that that little girl , who made a wrong decision at that moment , must be very panicked , and may be facing the most terrible situation of her life . 
through the telephone , she could roughly imagine that the little girl who had made a mistake on the spur of the moment was surely terrified , since she was facing what could be life 's most frightening circumstance . 
through the telephone , she could vaguely imagine that the little girl who had a momentary lapse in judgment with serious consequences must be extremely nervous and scared ; she was facing perhaps the most frightening circumstances ever in her life . 
犹豫 了 片刻 之后 , 她 的 脑海里 突然 冒 出 了 一个 念头 , 对 了 , 就 这样 做 . 

hesitating for a moment , an idea suddenly occurred to her . right , just do it this way . 
after she hesitated for a moment , she suddenly had an idea in her mind . yes , i will do it this way . 
after hesitating a moment , a thought suddenly came to her mind . yes , she would do it . 
after hesitating for a moment the teacher suddenly thought of an idea - - yes , she 'd just do it . 
于是 , 她 问 清 了 书店 的 地址 之后 , 就 赶 了 过去 . 

so , after making sure about the bookstore 's address , she hurried there . 
then , she asked for the detailed address of the bookstore , and hurried there . 
thereupon , after asking the bookstore 's address , she rushed over there . 
therefore , after she got the address of the bookstore , she immediately went there . 
正如 她 预料 的 那样 , 在 书店 里 站立 着 一位 满脸 泪 迹 的 小 女孩 , 

just as she expected , a tearful little girl was standing in the bookstore , 
as she expected , a little girl with tear stains all over her face was standing in the bookstore . 
just as she had anticipated , standing in the bookstore was a little girl with a face full of tears . 
just as she expected , in the bookstore stood a little girl with a face full of tears , 
而 旁边 的 大 人们 , 正 恶狠狠 的 大声 斥责 着 . 

while adults nearby were yelling at her in fierce reproof . 
and those adults standing around were scolding her ferociously in loud voices . 
the adults beside her were ferociously and loudly scolding her . 
and the adults around her were fiercely chiding her . 
她 一下 冲上去 , 将 那个 可怜 的 小 女孩 搂 在 怀里 , 转身 对 旁边 的 售货员 说道 : & quot ; 有 什么 跟 我 说 吧 , 不要 吓着 孩子 . & quot ; 

she rushed up to hold the poor little girl in her arms . turning around , she said to the sales person nearby : " talk to me . don 't scare the kid . " 
she rushed to the poor little girl and held her in her arms , and turned her head to the sales clerks around , and said : " talk to me if you have something to say . do not terrify the child . " 
she instantly rushed forward and gathered the pitiful little girl into her arms , then turned toward the nearby store clerk and said : " whatever you have to say you can say to me . you shouldn 't frighten children . " 
she rushed up at once , hugging that poor little girl and turning to the salesperson by her side , saying , " talk to me about this , don 't frighten the child . " 
在 售货员 不情愿 的 嘀咕 声 中 , 她 交 清 了 几十 元 罚款 , 才 领 着 这个 小 女孩 , 走出 了 书店 , 并 看清楚 了 那 张 被 泪水 与 惊恐 , 弄得 一塌糊涂 的 脸 . 

amid the sales person 's reluctant mutterings , she paid the fine of about a few dozen yuan before she was able to lead this little girl out of the bookstore and take a close look at that tear - smudged , terrified face . 
she took the little girl with her and walked out of the bookstore after she paid out several dozen yuan as a fine , while the sales clerks were whispering reluctantly . then , she could clearly see the face messed with tears and panic . 
during the muttering of the somewhat unwilling store clerk , she paid the fine of less than one hundred yuan and then , with the little girl in hand , walked out of the store where she could see clearly the face overwhelmed by panic and tears . 
while the salesperson grumbled that he was not willing , she handed over a fine of several tens of rmb before taking this little girl out of the bookstore and getting a clear look at a face in a complete mess with tears and panic . 
她 笑 了 起来 , 将 小 女孩 领到 家中 , 好好 清理 了 一下 , 什么都 没有 问 , 就让 小 女孩 离开 了 , 

she laughed and took the little girl home . she gave her a good cleaning and let the girl go without asking anything . 
she smiled , and brought the little girl home . she cleaned her up thoroughly and let her go without asking anything . 
she smiled and returned home with the little girl where she tidied her up without asking anything , then let the little girl leave , 
she began smiling and took the little girl to her home , cleaned her up without asking anything , and then allowed the little girl to leave . 
临走 时 , 她 还 特意 叮嘱 道 , 如果 你 要 看书 , 就 到 阿姨 这里 来 , 里面 有 好多 书 呢 . 

before she took off , she made a special effort to tell her repeatedly , if you want to read books , just come to the auntie 's place . there are many books inside . 
she especially urged her before she left , " if you want to read books , you could come here , auntie 's home has a lot of books . " 
as the little girl was about to go , she also made a point of urging , " if you want to read a book , then come here to auntie 's house . there are lots of books here . ' 
before she left , the teacher urged her : " if you want to read , just come to me ; there are many books here . " 
惊魂未定 的 小 女孩 , 深深的 看 了 她 一眼 , 便 飞 一般 的 跑 走 了 , 便 再也没有 出现 . 

the little girl , who had still not yet recovered from her horror , took a close look at her and scampered away . she never reappeared . 
the little girl , who was still in a panic , gazed at her deeply before running away , and never showed up again . 
the still badly shaken little girl looked are her deeply for a moment , then dashed off , after which she never came back . 
the little girl whose spirits were still rattled took a good look at her , and then ran off like she was flying , never appearing again . 
时间 如 流水 匆匆 而 过 , 不知不觉 间 , 十年 的 光阴 , 一晃 而 过 , 

time went by like a rushing stream . ten years had passed in a flash before she knew it . 
time passes as quickly as running water , and a period of ten years has passed in a flash without notice . 
time rushed by like running water . imperceptibly , ten years went by in a flash . 
time passed rapidly like running water , and without realizing it , ten years of time had passed in a flash ; 
她 早已 忘记 了 这件事 , 依旧 住 在这里 , 过 着 平静 安 祥 的 生活 . 

having long forgotten this thing , she still lived here , leading a quiet and peaceful life . 
she had forgotten the thing a long time ago , and still lives there with a calm and serene life . 
she had forgotten the incident , still living there as before , she led a calm and peaceful life . 
the teacher had already forgotten this event long ago , but she still lived in the same place , leading a peaceful and serene life .

当 她 打开 房门 后 , 看到 一位 年轻 漂亮 的 陌生 女孩 , 露 着 满脸 的 笑容 , 手中 还 捧 着 一 大 堆 礼物 .

& quot ; 你 找 谁 ?

& quot ; 她 疑惑 的 问道 ,

the girl was moved and talked with a lot of words . 
the young girl excitedly gave a long explanation . 
the girl then excitingly talked at length . 
好不容易 , 她 才 从 那个 陌生 女孩 的 叙述 中 , 恍然 发现 , 原来 她 就是 当年 的 那个 小 女孩 , 十年 之后 , 已经 顺利 从 大学 毕业 , 现在 还 特意 来 看望 自己 . 

only with great efforts in following the narration of that girl , a stranger to her , did she suddenly realize that she was that little girl of that year . she had graduated smoothly from college after ten years and now took this trip purposely to visit her . 
it was not easy for her to find out from the strange girl 's talking that she was the little girl of that year . ten years after , she had graduated from a university without any difficulties , and now she had made a special trip to see her . 
to her surprise , from the unfamiliar young lady 's story she suddenly realized that the young woman was actually the little girl from that year . ten years later , she had graduated from university without difficulty and had now come especially to call on her . 
with great difficulty , she suddenly discovered from the story told by this strange girl that it turned out she was the little girl from before , ten years before ; she had already graduated from college without any trouble , and now she had gone to the trouble to come to pay a call to the teacher . 
这个 年轻 女孩 眼睛 里 泛 着 泪 光 , 轻声 说道 : & quot ; 虽然 我 至今 都 不 明白 , 您 为什么 愿意 冒充 我 妈妈 , 解救 了 我 , 但 我 总 觉得 , 这 十年 来 , 一直 都 想 喊 您 一 声 , 妈妈 . & quot ; 

with her eyes glistening with tears , the young girl said softly : " though i have never understood even today why you were willing to pretend to be my mom to help me out , i have always felt all these ten years that i want to call you mom . " 
the young girl said with a soft voice and tears in her eyes : " although i still don 't understand why you were willing to pretend to be my mom and save me , during these 10 years , i have always felt that i want to call you mom . " 
the young woman 's eyes glistened with tears as she said in a gentle voice : " although i still don 't understand even today why you were willing to pass yourself off as my mother and come to my rescue , but for the last ten years i had a constant feeling that i wanted to cry out ' mother ' to you . " 
the eyes of this young girl were glinting with tears , and she spoke softly : " although i still don 't understand even to this day why were you willing to pretend you were my mother and rescue me , i always think , during these past ten years , about how i 've always wanted to call you mother . " 
老师 的 眼睛 里 , 也 开始 糊 模 起来 , 

the teacher 's eyes also grew blurry . 
the teacher 's eyes also started to become blurred . 
the teacher 's eyes started to cloud over as well . 
the teacher 's eyes also began to become fuzzy ; 
她 有些 好奇 的 问道 : & quot ; 如果 那天 我 不 帮 你 , 会 发生 怎样的 结果 ? & quot ; 

she asked curiously : " if i had not helped you , what would have happened ? " 
" if i did not help you that day , what was going to happen to you ? " she asked with curiosity . 
somewhat curious , she asked : " if i hadn 't helped you that day , what would have been the result ? " 
she asked with some curiosity : " if that day i had not helped you , what would have been the result ? " 
女孩 的 脸上 , 立即 变得 阴沉 下来 , 轻轻 摇 着 头 说道 : & quot ; 我 说 不 清楚 , 也许 就 会 去 做 傻事 , 甚至 是 去 死 . & quot ; 

the girl 's face immediately darkened . she gently shook her head and said : " i am not sure . i could have done something foolish and might have even committed suicide . " 
the face of the girl suddenly became gloomy . she shook her head slightly and said , " i cannot explain it clearly , i might have done a stupid thing or even killed myself . " 
the young woman 's face instantly darkened and she lightly shook her head , saying : " i 'm not sure . maybe i would have gone on doing stupid things , or i might even have died . " 
the girl 's face immediately became somber ; lightly she shook her head and said ; " i can 't say for sure ; perhaps i would have done something stupid , even died . " 
老师 的 心中 猛然 一 颤 , 开始 暗暗 庆幸 .

自己 当年 在 一 念 之间 所 做出 的 决定 , 竟然 可以 如此 影响到 一个人 的 一生 .

the decision she made at that moment in that year could even impact a person in her life . 
the impetuous decision that she had made back then had unexpectedly had such an influence on a person 's entire life . 
the decision that she made in a moment of thought that year could actually influence the life of a person in such a way as this .

如果 将 传统 的 消耗 式 战争 比喻 成 让 对手 流血 而 死 , 那么 现代 战争 则是 一 上来 就 朝 对手 的 脑袋 开 一 枪 , 让 其 来不及 流血 就 成为 " 植物人 " . 

if we liken a traditional war of attrition to making the enemy bleed to death , then modern warfare is firing a bullet right into the enemy 's head at the outset , turning it into a " vegetable " with no time to bleed . 
if traditional warfare of attrition is described as letting an opponent bleed to death , then modern warfare is shooting at the head of an opponent first and making him a " human vegetable " before he bleeds . 
if we describe conventional war of attrition as causing the opponent to bleed to death , then from the outset modern warfare consists of shooting a gun toward the opponent 's head in order to render him a " vegetable " even before there is time to bleed . 
if you make the analogy of a traditional war of attrition as making your opponent bleed until he dies , then modern warfare is like firing a gun into your opponent 's head , making him become a 'vegetable ' before he can even begin to bleed .

land - based air defense units are mainly equipped with a series of american - made ' hawks ' , british ' rapiers ' and some russian - made ' sam ' land - to - air missiles . 
对于 伊朗 防空 力量 的 现状 , 美国 军事 专家 哈罗德 · 胡奇 森 , 俄罗斯 政治 和 军事 分析 研究所 军事 专家 赫 拉姆 奇 欣 等人 分析 认为 , 就 目前 情况 看 , 伊朗 防空 能力 及 防空 体系 建设 仍然 存在 一些 漏洞 . 

analyzing the current status of the iranian air defense forces , harold hutchinson , a us military expert , khramchikhin , a military expert at russia 's institute of political and military analysis , and others think that looking at the current situation , there are still some holes in iran 's air defense capabilities and its air defense system construction . 
harold hutchinson , a us military expert , and helamuchisin , a military expert from russia 's politics and military analysis institute , analyzed the current status of the iranian air defense forces , and think that the iranian air defense capacities and air defense system and construction still have some loopholes in the current status . 
with regards to the current status of iran 's air - defense strength , analysis by individuals such as the us military expert harold hutchison and military expert [ hela muqixin ] of the [ russian political and military research institute ] indicates that , viewed from the present situation , there are still holes in iran 's air - defense capabilities and air - defense system . 
as to the present situation of iran 's air defense power , american military expert harold hutchinson and russian government and military analysis institute military expert vladimir mytashin and others have analyzed this . they believe that , looking at the current situation , there still exist some leaks in iran 's air defense abilities and the air defense system establishment . 
胡奇 森 认为 , 就 整体 实力 而言 , 伊朗 空军 与 美军 根本 不在 一个 档次 上 . 

hutchinson thinks that in terms of overall real power , the iranian air force is absolutely not at the same level as the us military . 
hutchinson thinks that the iranian air forces are not at all at the same level with the us armed forces from the perspective of whole actual strength . 
hutchison says that with respect to overall capabilities , iran 's air force simply is not on the same level as the us air force . 
hutchinson believes that , talking about its comprehensive strength , iran 's air forces and america 's military are just not on the same level . 
伊朗 装备 的 大量 美制 战机 由于 缺乏 零配件 和 升级 维护 而 无法 使用 , 

the large number of us - made fighter planes iran has are inoperable due to lack of spare parts , upgrades , and maintenance . 
a lot of the iranian combat aircrafts made by the us cannot be used because of lack of parts , upgrades , and maintenance . 
a large number of the us - manufactured jetfighters that iran is equipped with cannot be used because of a lack of spare parts and upgrading . 
a great number of american - made fighters that iran is equipped with cannot be used because they lack spare parts and need upgraded maintenance . 
曾 被 视为 伊朗 空军 王牌 的 F-14 型 战机 至今 也 只有 10余 架 能 起飞 升空 , 

of the f-14 fighters , once considered the trump of the iranian air force , currently only 10 - plus can take off . 
the f-14 fighter planes previously regarded as the elite ones in the iranian air force only have about ten capable of taking off from the ground . 
the f-14 fighter was once the trump card of iran 's air force , but today there are only ten or so that are able to fly . 
as of now only about 10 or a few more of the f-14 fighters which were once seen as the trump card in iran 's air force can even get off the ground and fly , 
所 挂 载 的 号称 具有 超 视距 攻击 能力 的 AIM-54 型 " 不 死 鸟 " 导弹 的 实战 可靠性 也 令人 怀疑 . 

it is also questionable whether the aim-54 phoenix missiles that they carry , which are said to have over - the - horizon attack capability , are reliable in actual battle . 
the combat reliability of aim 54 " phoenix " missiles , claimed to be capable of over - the - horizon attacks , is also doubtful . 
the dependability in actual combat of the aim-54 phoenix missiles they carry , known for their ultra - long distance attack capabilities , is also doubtful . 
and the actual battle reliability of the aim-54 model ' phoenix ' cruise missile , which is reputed to have over the horizon strike ability , is suspicious . 
赫 拉姆 奇 欣 则 指出 , 美国 在 上个世纪 七 八十年代 向 伊朗 提供 的 防空 导弹 系统 由于 缺少 备件 而 已经 失去 了 作战 能力 , 

khramchikhin mentioned that the air defense missile systems that the us provided to iran in the 1970s and 1980s have lost combat power due to lack of spare parts . 
helamuchisin pointed out that those iranian air defense missile systems provided by the us from the 1970s to the 1980s of the last century have lost their combat powers because of lack of spare parts . 
[ hela muqixin ] points out however that the air - defense missile systems provided to iran by the us in the 1970s and 1980s have lost their warfare capabilities because of a lack of spare parts . 
mytashin points out that the air defense missile systems that america supplied to iran in the 70's and 80's have already lost their battle abilities because they lack spare parts , 
而 从 俄罗斯 等 国 得到 的 其他 一些 不成 体系 的 防空 武器 , 根本 无力 对付 有着 强大 电磁 对抗 能力 的 美军 . 

some other non - system air defense weapons acquired from russia and other countries are no match for the us military , which is capable of electromagnetic countermeasures . 
and other air defense weapons that do not form any systems , such as weapons obtained from russia and other countries , have no capabilities at all to cope with the us armed forces , which have powerful electromagnetic combat capabilities . 
in addition , the other non - systematic air - defense weapons obtained from russia and other countries are simply incapable of countering us forces possessing powerful electromagnetic countermeasure capabilities . 
and some other air defense weapons not incorporated into their own systems obtained from russia and other countries have no ability whatsoever to contend with american forces that have strong electromagnetic countermeasures . 
东拼西凑 影响 战斗力 

scraping it together has an effect on combat power . 
scrappy weapons affect combat power 
scraping together a military affects battle capability 
a pieced together force influences iran 's fighting power 
伊朗 政府 显然 也 认识到 自己 在 战争 中 的 命运 取决于 是否 能 守得住 头顶 上 的 天空 , 并 采取 临阵磨枪 , 东拼西凑 , 强化 其 防空 体系 . 

the iranian government obviously also realizes that its fate in war depends on its ability to defend the home skies . in a last - minute effort to update its weaponry , it scraped together all it could get to reinforce its air defense system . 
apparently , the iranian government realizes that its fate in a war depends on whether it is capable of defending the sky over its head , and is starting to prepare only at the last moment , scrape weapons together , and strengthen its air defense system . 
clearly , iran 's government is also aware that its fate in a conflict depends upon whether it can defend the sky above and it has been carrying out eleventh - hour preparations by scraping together whatever it can find in order to build up its air - defense system . 
iran 's government obviously has recognized that its fate in a war depends on whether or not it can defend the skies above its head , and has thus made preparations at the last minute , and tried to further piece together and strengthen its air defense systems . 
目前 来看 , 其 办法 可以 归结为 两 招 : 

from what can be seen at present , its methods can be summarized into two . 
its methods can be summed up as the two strategies from the current state : 
at present , its methods can be summarized into two devices : 
looking at this at the present , iran 's method can be boiled down to these two strategies : 
首先 将 重要 的 核 设施 极力 隐藏 起来 , 加强 其 抗 打击 能力 . 

first , work hard to conceal key nuclear facilities to enhance its capability to defend against attacks . 
the first one is to conceal important nuclear facilities as much as possible and strengthen their anti - strike capabilities . 
the first is an all - out effort to conceal key nuclear facilities and beef up their defense capabilities . 
first , hide important nuclear facilities with the utmost effort , and strengthen their ability to resist attack . 
据 英国 " 泰晤士报 " 报道 , 伊朗 已经 将 纳坦兹 核 工厂 , 伊斯法罕 铀 浓缩 中心 等 核 设施 的 核心 部件 深 藏 在 了 18 米 深 的 地下 , 并 加上 了 2 米 厚 的 混凝土 防护 壳 . 

according to a report by the british newspaper the times , iran has concealed the core parts of nuclear facilities such as the natanz nuclear plant and isfahan uranium enrichment center as deep as 18 meters underground and encased them with 2 - meter thick cement protection . 
according to a report from the british newspaper times , iran has hidden core parts of its nuclear facilities 18 meters under ground and added a protection shell of 2 - meter - thick cement , including the nuclear plant in natanz and the uranium enrichment center in isfahan . 
according to a report in the british newspaper the times , iran has hidden the natanz nuclear facility , the isfahan uranium enrichment center and other core components of their nuclear facilities eighteen meters underground and added a two - meter thick concrete protection shell . 
according to england 's " the times , " iran already has deeply hidden its natanz nuclear factory and isfahan uranium enrichment center 18 meters underground , and added a two - meter thick concrete protecting shell . 
然而 美军 棋 先 一 招 , 早在 1991年 海湾战争 时期 , 就 看到 了 地下 掩体 在 防 空袭 作战 中 的 效能 , 并 突击 研 发出 各种 钻 地 炸弹 . 

however , the us military is a step ahead , having seen the effects of underground bunkers during the 1991 gulf war in defending against air strikes , it rushed development of various kinds of ground penetrating bombs . 
but the us armed forces have taken a strategy in advance . they saw the effects of underground bunkers in anti - air attack combat as early as during the gulf war in 1991 , and have rushed developing various ground - penetrating bombs . 
but the us military is one step ahead . as early as the 1991 persian gulf war , it saw the effectiveness of underground bunkers in anti - aircraft defense and rushed to develop various types of earth - penetrating bombs . 
however , american forces are one step ahead . as early as during the 1991 gulf war , america had seen the efficiency of underground bunkers in air defense warfare and carried out an onslaught of research and development on various kinds of earth - penetrating bombs . 
经过 10 多年 有 针对性 的 研究 , 美军 现在 已经 有了 一整套 对付 地下 加固 掩体 的 战法 和 武器 . 

after more than ten years of targeted research , the us military now has a complete package of combat methodology and weapons to deal with reinforced underground bunkers . 
through more than 10 years ' studies on targets , the us armed forces have had a whole set of combat methods and weapons coping with underground consolidated bunkers . 
after ten years of focused research , the us military has a full complement of strategies and weapons to counter reinforced underground bunkers . 
after more than 10 years of specific research and development , american forces now already have a whole series of battle methods and weapons to deal with underground reinforced bunkers . 
伊朗 近来 还 从 俄罗斯 大量 采购 先进 的 防空 武器 . 

iran has recently also bought large quantities of air defense weaponry from russia . 
iran has also purchased a lot of advanced air defense weapons from russia in recent years . 
iran has recently also bought a large amount of advanced air - defense weapons from russia . 
recently iran also purchased advanced air defense weapons from russia . 
自 去年 年底 以来 , 伊 政府 与 俄罗斯 接连 达成 了 采购 " 伯朝拉 " -2A 型 防空 导弹 系统 及 价值 7亿 美元 的 29套 " 道尔 " -M1 型 防空 导弹 系统 . 

since the end of last year , the iranian government has made successive agreements with russia to purchase the pechora-2a air defense missile system , along with 29 sets of the tor-m1 air defense missile system worth 700 million us dollars . 
since the end of last year , the iranian government has reached agreements with russia , one after another , for the purchase of the pechora-2a air defense missile system and 29 sets of " dower " air defense missile systems , worth 700 million us dollars . 
since the end of last year , iran 's government has reached a series of agreements with russia to purchase pechora-2a air defense missile systems as well as 29 tor-m1 air - defense missile systems valued at us $ 700 m . 
since late last year , the iranian government and russia have successively reached agreements on the purchase of ' pechora ' 2a model air defense missile systems , as well as 29 ' tor " m1 model air defense missile systems worth 700 million usd . 
然而 , 现代 战争 是 体系 与 体系 的 较量 . 

however , modern warfare is a competition between systems . 
however , a modern war is a rivalry between systems . 
however , modern warfare is a contest of system against system . 
however , modern warfare is a measuring of system against system . 
美军 的 各种 空袭 兵器 都 为 本国 自主 研发 , 而且 经过 多年 实战 磨练 , 已经 被 磨合 成为 一套 效能 可观 的 战争 机器 . 

the various air strike weapons of the us military were all developed independently by their own country . furthermore , after years of real war experience , they have been adapted into a set of impressive and effective war machines . 
various us armed forces air - attack weapons are developed by the us itself , and they have been sharpened and become a set of war machines with outstanding effects after years of tests in actual warfare . 
the various air - attack weapons of the us military have all been developed by the country itself for its own benefit and , through many years of perfectioning in actual combat , they have been molded into an impressive war machine . 
all of america 's various air strike weapons were researched and developed by america , have seen many years of actual battle hardening , and have already been ground into a set of battle machines with objective effectiveness . 
而 伊朗 从 别国 东拼西凑 而来 的 " 新式 武器 " , 能否 在 这么 短 时间 能 形成 战斗力 还是 问题 . 

in contrast , whether the " new weapons " iran gathered from other countries and put together can become a combat force within such short period of time is still an issue . 
and those " new weapons " scraped together by iran from other countries are still a question of whether they can form combat power in a short time . 
on the other hand , iran 's " up - to - date weapons " have been scraped together from other countries . whether or not they can be made combat effective in such a short time is still in question . 
whereas iran has been piecing together 'new weapons ' from other countries . it is still a question if iran can create any battle power in such a short time . 
伊朗 的 差距 不仅 在 武器 

iran is not lagging behind in weapons only . 
weapons are not iran 's only gap . 
iran 's lags behind not only in weapons 
iran 's deficiencies not only in weapons 
美军 1982年 出版 的 " 作战 纲要 " 第一次 提出 " 空地 一体 战 " 思想 , 强调 凭借 空中 优势 对 敌方 战略 纵深 高 价值 目标 进行 打击 , 在 开战 伊始 瘫痪 对方 的 指挥 体系 , 让 敌方 纵 有 再 强大 的 常规 兵力 也 只能 成为 " 砧板 上 的 肉 " . 

the army field manual published by the us military in 1982 proposed for the first time the doctrine of " air land battle , " which emphasizes attacking the enemy 's deeply strategic and high - value targets using air superiority to paralyze the enemy 's command system at the start of the war so that the enemy can become nothing more than " meat on the chopping board " no matter how powerful its regular military strength . 
combat outlines , published by the us armed forces in 1982 , first came up with the idea of " integrated air - ground warfare , " and stressed the use of air supremacy to strike high - value targets in an enemy 's strategic depth area , paralyzing the enemy 's command system at the beginning of a war , and making him as " meat on the cutting board " even though he has very powerful conventional forces . 
the concept of " air - land battle " was first raised in " operations " , published by the us military in 1982 . it stresses reliance on strength in the air to carry out attacks against the enemy 's strategically valuable targets . this paralyses the other side 's command systems at the start of the war and turns the enemy 's conventional forces , even if they are superior , into a " slab of meat on a cutting board . " 
the ' airland battle ' concept was first brought up in " operations " published by the u.s. armed forces in 1982 . it emphasized taking advantage of air superiority to carry out strikes on the enemy 's strategic high value targets , and paralyzing the command system of the enemy as soon as war began , making enemies with even large and strong regular armed forces just " a piece of meat on the cutting board . " 
1991年 海湾战争 , 1999年 科索沃 战争 和 2003年 的 伊拉克 战争 中 , 美军 在乎 的 并不是 对手 有 多少 架 飞机 , 而是 自己的 " 战 斧 " 式 巡航导弹 的 射程 . 

in the 1991 gulf war , the 1999 kosovo war , and the 2003 iraq war , the us military cared not about how many planes the enemy had but the range of its own tomahawk cruise missiles . 
in the gulf war in 1991 , kosovo war in 1999 , and the iraq war in 2003 , what the us armed forces paid attention to was not how many aircrafts the opponents had , but the firing range of their own " tomahawk " cruise missile . 
in the 1991 persian gulf war , the 1999 kosovo war and the 2003 iraq war , the us military did not concern itself with how many planes the opponent had , but rather the range of its own tomahawk cruise missiles . 
in the 1991 gulf war , the 1999 kosovo war and the 2003 iraq war , what american forces have been concerned about is not how many aircraft the opponent has , but instead the range of its ' tomahawk ' cruise missiles . 
尽管 伊朗 政府 已经 在 为 可能 发生 的 空袭 而 进行 准备 , 并 开始 采取 措施 加强 防空 能力 , 但 与 伊拉克 8 年 战争 中 不分 高下 的 伊朗 , 似乎 还 没有 读懂 现代 高科技 战争 的 真正 含义 . 

although the iranian government has been preparing for possible air strikes and has started taking measures to enhance its air defense capabilities , iran , which fought an eight - year war with iraq without any distinguishable winner , does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high - tech warfare . 
although the iranian government has prepared for possible air attacks and started to take measures to strengthen air defense capabilities , iran , which came to a draw with iraq in an eight - year war , does not seem to understand the real meaning of modern high - tech warfare . 
even if iran 's government has prepared for a possible air attack and has begun to take steps to reinforce its air - defense capabilities , iran , which fought to a stalemate in an eight - year war with iraq , seems not to have fully understood the true meaning of modern hi - tech warfare . 
the iranian government is already carrying out preparations for air strikes that might happen , and has also begun procedures to strengthen its air defense abilities . however , iran , which fought an eight - year war with iraq with no clear winner , still seems not to have come to an understanding of the true meaning of modern high - tech warfare . 
随着 美军 近年来 军事 转型 工作 的 进展 , 美军 的 空袭 行动 已经 完全 不同于 越南 战争 时期 的 地毯 式 轰炸 , 而是 依赖 各种 高新技术 兵器 , 依托 当代 信息技术 的 高 精度 , 全 纵深 的 空中 打击 . 

along with the us military 's progress in recent years in military transformation work , the us military 's air strike operations already completely differ from vietnam war era carpet bombing , depending instead on various kinds of high - tech weapons and on modern information technology - based high precision and full depth air attacks . 
with the development of us armed forces military transition work in recent years , the air - attack activities of the us armed forces are totally different from the carpet bombing method in the vietnam war era , and rely on various new high - tech weapons and high - precision and whole - depth air strikes that are based on modern information technology . 
with the progress of the us military 's military transformation in recent years , the us military 's air - attack operations are completely different from the carpet bombing of the vietnam war and instead rely on full - depth air assaults with various hi - tech weapons and modern information technology . 
with the progress of military restructuring of american forces over the past few years , america 's air strike performance is already totally different than the carpet bombing of the vietnam era , and instead relies on various high - tech weapons , the support of high accuracy current information technology and total - depth air strike ability . 
面对 这样的 空袭 , 伊朗 地面 防空 体系 能 撑 多久 还是 个 未知数 . 

confronted with such air strikes , it is still unknown how long iran 's land - based air defense system would be able to hold on . 
how long the iranian ground air defense system can sustain itself in this kind of air strikes is still an unknown element . 
faced with this kind of air assault , how long iran 's land - based air defense systems can hold out is an unknown . 
facing these kind of air strikes , exactly how long iran 's land - based air defense systems can last is still an unknown .

我 记得 2005年初 的 时候 , 香港 " 苹果 日报 " 刊登 了 一篇 文章 , 题目 叫 " 法 轮 常 转 , 功 可 敌国 " , 

i remember that at the beginning of 2005 , hong kong 's apple daily published an article entitled " as falun wheel revolves , its contributions rival those of government . " 
i remember that in the beginning of 2005 , apple journal in hong kong published an article titled " dharma wheel spins constantly and its merits can overcome an enemy country . " 
i remember that at the beginning of 2005 hong kong 's apple daily carried an article titled " falun rotates continuously and its gong may be able to defeat a regime " . 
i remember at the beginning of 2005 , hong kong 's " apple daily " published an article ; its title was " the falun wheel turns often to capture the enemy nation . " 
文中 称 2004年 是 法 轮 功 高歌猛进 的 一 年 . 

the article called 2004 a year of great advancement for falun gong . 
the article alleged that 2004 was a year in which falun gong advanced rapidly while singing triumphant songs . 
the article states that 2004 was a year in which falun gong advanced triumphantly . 
the article said that 2004 was a year in which falun gong advanced triumphantly . 
文中 列举 中共 海外 官员 为 - 压制 法 轮 功 在 各种 场合 仪态 尽 失 , 而 法 轮 功 学员 在 世界 各地 讲 真相 令 中共 丢 尽 脸面 等等 . 

the article gave many examples of how overseas cpc officials completely lost their manners in suppressing falun gong on various occasions , while falun gong practitioners told the truth all over the world , making the cpc completely lose face . 
the article stated that overseas officials of the chinese communist party acted like buffoons suppressing falun gong in various places , and totally lost face when beginning falun gong learners told the truths everywhere in the world . 
the article lists examples of various occasions and situations where suppression of the falun gong movement by mainland china 's overseas officials failed and relates how falun gong practitioners speaking the truth around the world have caused mainland china to completely lose face . 
the article enumerated that all the manners in which the chinese communist party (ccp) overseas officials took to repress falun gong in various situations all failed , and students of falun gong across the world spoke the truth and left the ccp without any face . 
但 若 比较 05 年 " 九 评 " 所 引发 退党 大潮 的 波澜壮阔 , 04 年 好像 也 不算 什么 了 . 

however , in comparison with the vast massive wave of withdrawals from the party triggered by the " nine commentaries " in 2005 , the year 2004 did not seem impressive . 
but compared with the marvelous scene showing the great wave of party membership withdrawal brought by the " nine comments " in 2005 , 2004 does not seem outstanding . 
but 2004 doesn 't seem to have been anything special when compared to the powerful momentum of 2005 's withdraw - from - the - party movement , which was caused by the book nine commentaries on the communist party . 
but if you compare the great surge of those quitting the party because of the " nine criticisms " of 2005 , then 2004 really doesn 't seem like much . 
- 那么 , 06 年 将会 如何 呢 ? 

- well , what will things be like in 2006 ? 
then , how will 2006 be ? 
so , what will 2006 bring ? 
so , what will 2006 bring ? 
从 今年初 发生 的 两 件 事 大概 可以 看出 今年 发展 的 一点 端倪 . 

from two incidents that occurred at the beginning of this year , we can probably see some clues about this year 's developments . 
the two events that occurred at the beginning of this year can probably demonstrate some development track for this year . 
we can probably get a hint of how this year will develop from two events that occurred at the start of the year . 
from two events that happened early this year we can get an inkling as to the development of this year . 
一个 是 法 轮 功 创始人 发表 的 " 除 恶 " , 这 篇 文章 宣判 了 99 年 720 以后 中共 特务 的 末日 将 至 . 

one is the publication of " eliminating evils " by the falun gong founder . this article announced the imminent doom of those who became cpc spies after july 20, 1999 . 
one is the article " elimination of evil " published by the founder of falun gong . this article announced and sentenced that those agents of the chinese communist party will face their coming judgment day after july 20, 1999 . 
one was the publication of " on eliminating evil " by the creator of falun gong . the article pronounced that , following july 20, 1999 , the final days of mainland china 's secret agents were nigh . 
the first event is the publishing of " eradicating evil . " this article pronounces a sentence that the final day of the ccp 's special operatives after july 20, 1999 will soon arrive . 
对于 这 篇 文章 , 也许 很多 人 还 将信将疑 或 不能 相信 , 

perhaps many people are still skeptical about or cannot believe this article . 
maybe many people still have doubts about or disbelieve this article . 
as for this article , many people may half believe it or disbelieve it . 
in regards to this article , perhaps many people will waver between believing or doubting it , or will not be able to believe it , 
但 不管 信不信 , 历史 与 - 事实 将 做出 证明 ! 

yet , whether believing it or not , history and facts will be the proof ! 
but no matter whether they believe it or not , the history and facts will prove it ! 
but regardless of whether it is believed or not , history and facts will prove it ! 
but no matter if you believe it or not , history and fact will provide proof ! 
当然 , 中共 的 特务 就 好像 生活 在 阴沟 里 的 老鼠 , 

of course , cpc spies are like rats living in the sewer . 
of course , those agents of the chinese communist party (ccp) are like rats living in dark ditches . 
of course , the chinese communist party 's secret agents are like rats that live in the sewers . 
of course , the special operatives of the ccp are just like rats that live in the sewer , 
他们 的 " 自然 或 意外 " 死亡 并 不会 引起 社会 和 舆论 的 关注 , 

their " natural or accidental " deaths won 't rouse social or public attention . 
their " natural or accidental death " will not draw attention from the society and public opinion . 
their " natural or accidental " death will not attract the attention of society and public opinion . 
their " natural or unnatural " death will not bring the attention of society or public opinion , 
但是 海内外 中共 特务 的 大面积 天 灭 或 悔悟 必将 对 中共 权力 阶层 带 - 来 强大 的 冲击 和 震撼 ! 

but the widespread natural elimination of or repentance by cpc spies both at home and abroad will surely produce a powerful impact and shock to the cpc power structure . 
but broad deaths or remorse of ccp agents at home and abroad brought by the heavens will definitely bring powerful strikes and shake the power strata of the ccp . 
but the large scale striking down or repentance of the ccp 's overseas secret agents will inevitably deliver a heavy blow and a great shock to the power - wielding strata of the ccp . 
however , the large - scale smiting or repentance of domestic and foreign based ccp operatives will bring about a huge attack and convulsion to the ccp power hierarchy ! 
在 天 灭 威严 的 震慑 之下 , 他们 将 不得不 认真 思考 自己的 退路 和 生路 - - 退党 , 叛逃 或 倒戈 . 

stunned and awed by the power of natural elimination , they will have to seriously consider their route of retreat and survival - withdrawal from the party , defection , or counterattack . 
they will have to carefully consider their path of retreat and road for life - withdrawal from the party , desertion or changing their side under the awesome deterrence of the elimination brought by the heavens . 
frightened by the awe - inspiring threat of being struck down , they have no choice but to carefully consider their own means of escape and survival - - - withdrawing from the party , defecting and fighting against the ccp . 
under the awful magnitude of the smiting of their world , they will have to seriously consider their path of retreat and path of life - - quit the party , revolt and run , or change sides . 
由此 , 由 肮脏 的 利益 所 维系 的 " 中共 超 稳定 官僚 体系 集团 - " 将 开始 走向 动摇 , 瓦解 和 崩溃 ! 

consequently , " the cpc ultra stable bureaucracy group " maintained by filthy interests will start to shake , crumble , and collapse ! 
thus , the " superbly stable bureaucratic system and group of the ccp " will begin to be shaken , disrupted , and collapse ! 
for this reason , the ccp 's " ultra - stable bureaucratic organization " , held together by squalid self interest , will start to move toward shakiness , disintegration and collapse ! 
because of this , the ' ccp hyper - stable bureaucratic system bloc ' held up by filthy interests will begin to shake , dissolve and collapse ! 
还有 一件 事 就是 由 高智 晟 所 发起 的 维权 绝食 抗争 运动 . 

another incident is the hunger strike protest movement initiated by gao zhisheng to safeguard human rights . 
the other event is the hunger strike campaign for human rights launched by gao zhicheng . 
another event was the human - rights hunger - strike protest movement launched by gao zhisheng . 
there is also one event , that is , the hunger strike movement against those maintaining power begun by gao zhisheng . 
这 件 突然 而 起 , 开始 并不 被 人 看好 的 行动 却 出乎意料 的 得到 了 来自 全球 各地 的 热烈 响应 , 而且 是 各方 人士 , 各方 力量 - 的 共同 响应 . 

this movement , which started suddenly and was not regarded by people as having potential at the beginning , on the contrary received an unexpectedly enthusiastic response from around the world , and a joint response from various sectors and forces at that . 
this suddenly arisen campaign , which did not receive a good prediction from some people in the beginning , unexpectedly brought warm reactions from everywhere in the world , and common responses from all strata and various forces . 
it erupted suddenly and initially wasn 't well - regarded , but it unexpectedly received an enthusiastic response from around the world as well as a collective response from people from all walks of life and various influential bodies . 
this movement that began suddenly and was not well received at first , exceeded expectations and received an enthusiastic response from all over the world , and was responded to jointly by figures and forces everywhere . 
如果 这次 行动 能够 成为 会聚 各方 正义 力量 和 苦难 民众 的 一个 纽带 , 并 把 他 做成 做大 , 那么 给 中共 这个 危如累卵 的 罪恶 政权 最后 一 击 的 外力 将 可望 由此 形成 . 

if this movement can become a tie to gather various forces of justice and the suffering masses , making it a widespread success , then there is hope that an external force will take shape from this to serve as the last straw for the unstable , evil cpc regime . 
if this activity can integrate various just forces and suffering masses into a connection and make it real and big , then the outside force that launches the final strike on the ccp , the evil regime that is as fragile as a pile of eggs , will finally be formed from it . 
if this movement can become a bond bringing together the suffering people and various influential bodies fighting for justice , and can be made stronger , then there might be hope that the outside force that deals the final blow to the ccp , an evil regime in a very precarious situation , may take shape from here . 
if this movement can become a nexus between various righteous powers and the suffering people , as well as become successful and large , then the final hit to the ccp , this wicked regime that is on the precipice ready to fall , will be given . 
如果说 , 05 年 是 在 精神 层面 灭 共 的 一 年 , 那么 06 年 将 进入 精神 和 物质 两 个 层面 同时 灭 共 的 阶段 . 

if we say 2005 was a year in which the cpc was destroyed spiritually , then 2006 will begin a phase in which the cpc will be eliminated both spiritually and materially . 
if we say that 2005 was a year when the communist party was eliminated from the perspective of the spiritual aspect , then 2006 will be the phase in which the party will be gotten rid of in both the spiritual and material aspects . 
if it can be said that 2005 was the year that the communist party was destroyed at the spiritual level , then in 2006 things will have entered into the stage where the communist party is destroyed at the spiritual and material level . 
if we say that 2005 was the year that defeated communism on the spiritual level , then 2006 is the stage of defeating communism on a spiritual and material level . 
随着 " 九 评 " 的 进一步 传播 , 退党 潮 的 深入 推进 , 中共 自身 的 瓦解 和 外 - 部 正义 力量 的 凝聚 成型 , 中共 恶魔 的 寿命 将 正式 进入 倒计时 ! 

with the further spread of the " nine commentaries " and the deepening wave of withdrawal from the party , with the internal collapse of the cpc and the convergence of external forces of justice , the life of the cpc devil will officially enter the count - down period . 
with the further spread of the " nine comments " and further development of the wave of party membership withdrawal , the self - disruption of the ccp , and the cohesion and formation of outside just forces , the life of the ccp monster will formally enter into a countdown state . 
following further dissemination of the nine commentaries and growth in the wave of withdrawals from the party , the disintegration of the ccp and the consolidation of external forces fighting for justice , the countdown has begun for the end of the lifespan of the fiendish ccp ! 
with the further promulgation of the " nine criticisms , " the deepening of the tide of people quitting the party , the self - dissolution of the ccp itself and the agglomeration and shaping up of outside righteous power , the life of the ccp monster will formally enter its final hours ! 
天意 人意 已 相 融合 , 神力 人力 正在 会聚 . 

the intent of heaven and the people is harmonious ; the power of god and the people are converging . 
the wills of the heavens and humans have been integrated , and the sacred power and human strength are gathering . 
the will of heaven and the will of the people have merged . the strength of the spirits and the strength of man are joining together . 
the desires of heaven and earth have already coalesced , the hand of god and the power of the people are currently assembling . 
倚 天 长剑 直指 中共 恶魔 ! 

the giant sword is pointing directly at the cpc devil . 
the long sword in the sky is directly pointed at the ccp monster ! 
the heavenly sword is pointing straight at the demon ccp ! 
the long sword that relies on heaven is directly pointed at the ccp monster ! 
若 说 04 年 是 高歌猛进 的 一 年 , 05 年 是 波澜壮阔 的 一 年 , 那么 06 年 的 结语 将会 是 什么 呢 ? 

if we say 2004 was a year of great advancement and 2005 was a year of surging momentum , then what will be the final conclusion for 2006 ? 
if we say that 2004 was a year for advancing rapidly while singing triumphant songs , and 2005 is a marvelous year , then what will be the conclusion of 2006 ? 
if it can be said that 2004 was a year of marching forward in militant song and 2005 was a year of moving forward with great momentum , then what will be the closing assessment of 2006 ? 
if you say 2004 was a year in which we advanced triumphantly , and 2005 is a year in which we surged forward with great momentum , then what will the end words be for 2006 ? 
我 希望 是 惊 天 巨变 , 胜利 凯旋 ! 

i hope it is stunning transformation and triumph ! 
i hope it will be a shocking great change , and a victory and triumphant return ! 
i hope it is an earthshaking radical change and triumphant return in victory ! 
i hope it will be a huge change that startles heaven , victory and triumphant return !

临沂 计划生育 在 全省 排 倒数 第一 , 

family planning in linyi ranked at the bottom in the entire province . 
the family planning of linyi is the first one from the bottom of the provincial list in the whole province . 
province wide , linyi ranks last in planned parenthood . 
linyi 's family planning is dead last for the entire province , 
作为 市委 书记 你 心里 有些 着急 这 可以 理解 , 

it was understandable that you felt somewhat worried as a municipal party committee secretary . 
the anxiety in your mind is understandable as the secretary of the city party committee . 
as municipal party secretary , it is understandable that you are somewhat anxious . 
and as the secretary of the city committee , you being somewhat worried is understandable . 
但 你 以为 临沂 人 素质 差 只能 用 暴力 强制 才能 实施 国家 法律 政策 就 错 了 . 

however , you were wrong to think that people in linyi are so crude that force must be used to implement the national law and policy . 
but it is wrong for you to think that only use of violence and force can implement the state 's law and policy because of the low qualities of the people in linyi . 
but you are mistaken in your belief that the people of linyi are of such low upbringing that it is necessary to use violence and coercion to implement state laws and policies . 
however , thinking that you can only use violence and force to implement national legal policies because linyi 's citizens are unsophisticated is wrong . 
公民 对 政府 的 行为 不 配合 , 这 到底 是 谁 的 错 ? 

whose fault was it if citizens did not cooperate with the government 's action ? 
whose fault exactly is it that citizens do not coordinate with the conduct of the government ? 
if citizens do not act in concert with the actions of government , in the end whose fault is it ? 
citizens not cooperating with the behavior of the government , in the end whose fault is this ? 
是 因为 公民 素质 差 , 还是 因为 政府 长期以来 谎言 诡计 太多 导致 公信力 太 差 ? 

was it because citizens were crude or because the government has a poor public credibility as a result of its numerous lies and tricks over a long period of time ? 
is it because of the low qualities of the citizens or much less public trust , since the government has told too many lies and made too many schemes ? 
is it because the citizens are of low upbringing or is it because for a long time the government has engaged in so much lying and deception that its public credibility is too low ? 
is it because citizens are unsophisticated , or is it because the government has for a long time used lies and deceits leading to very low public confidence ? 
如果说 , 十年 前 同样 的 政府 行为 还 不是 显得 那么 荒唐 的话 , 到 了 2005年 , 在 中国 社会 已经 有了 明显 进步 人权 保障 已经 写入 宪法 的 2005年 , 你 不 觉得 你们 的 野蛮 行为 显得 太 离谱 了 吗 ? 

if the same action by the government ten years ago did not appear that absurd , don 't you think your barbarous action was way out of line in 2005 when the chinese society had achieved remarkable progress and when the human rights protection had been written into the constitution ? 
if (we) say that the same government 's conduct was not that absurd ten years ago , in 2005 china 's society has made obvious progress and human rights protection has been written into the constitution ; don 't you think that your barbarous conduct is too outrageous ? 
assuming that ten years ago the same type of actions by government didn 't seem so outrageous , don 't you feel that , in 2005 , when chinese society has made clear progress and human - rights guarantees have been written into the constitution , your savage acts seem ludicrous ? 
if you say that 10 years ago this kind of governmental behavior still didn 't seem that preposterous ; then in 2005 , when chinese society has already had obvious improvements and human rights protection has already been added into the constitution , don 't you think that your barbaric behavior is far off the mark ? 
你 为什么 不 反思 一下 , 怎么 只有 你们 临沂 还 敢 这样 搞 ? 

why don 't you reexamine yourself as to how it was that your linyi alone dare do such things ? 
why don 't you examine that only your linyi dares to act in this way ? 
think about it for a moment . how is it that only you people in linyi dare to act this way ? 
why don 't you think about it a bit ? why is it only you guys in linyi that still dare to do stuff like this ? 
怎么 只有 你们 临沂 不能 用 民主 法治 的 手段 执法 ? 

how could it be that your linyi alone could not implement the law using the means of democratic rule of law ? 
why is only your linyi unable to practice law enforcement by using democratic and legal means ? 
how is it that only you people in linyi are unable to enforce the law using democratic and legal methods ? 
how is it that you guys in linyi cannot use democratic and legal methods to enforce the law ? 
在 陈光 诚 等 一批 勇敢 的 公民 举报 野蛮 执法 的 事实 , 在 滕 彪 等 一批 勇于 维护 公民 的 权利 的 法律 人 介入 , 在 国家 计生委 作出 了 调查 结论 之后 , 临沂市 本来 可以 诚恳 地 做出 解释 获得 公众 的 谅解 , 

after chen guangcheng and a number of brave citizens reported the truth about the barbarous way of implementing the law , after teng biao and a number of legal professionals daring to safeguard citizens ' rights got involved , and after the national family planning commission made the conclusion of the investigation , linyi should have offered a sincere explanation to gain the understanding of the public .

in the wake of the reports by chen guangcheng and other courageous citizens regarding the savage enforcement of laws , the brave intercedence by teng biao and other legal personnel to protect the rights of citizens , as well as the conclusions drawn from the investigation by the state family planning commission , the city of linyi could have , in good faith , offered an explanation and reached a compromise with the public . 
when chen guangcheng and a group of brave citizens reported the facts of this barbaric enforcing of the law , through the involvement of teng biao and a group of lawyers bravely maintaining the rights of citizens and after the state family planning committee completed its investigations , linyi city could have heartily given an explanation and come to an understanding with the public . 
毕竟 , 计划生育 是 一个 中国 特色 的 难题 , 

after all , family planning is a tough subject with chinese characteristics . 
after all , family planning is a difficult topic with chinese characteristics . 
when all is said and done , family planning is a difficult problem that is specific to china . 
after all , family planning is a problem characteristic of china . 
大家 也 都 可以 体谅 你们 的 难处 . 

people could also have understood your difficulties . 
everyone can understand your difficulties . 
likewise , we can all empathize with the difficult situation you are in . 
everybody could have understood and forgiven your difficulties . 
可是 , 你们 却 进一步 采取 荒唐 的 做法 - - 把 陈光 诚 从 北京 抓回去 关起来 , 还 试图 给 他 安 一个 非法 提供 国家 秘密 情报 的 罪名 . 

yet , you people instead adopted an absurd move - catching chen guangcheng in beijing and bringing him back to be locked up . you even attempted to incriminate him in the name of illegally supplying state secret intelligence . 
however , you took a further absurd measure - brought chen guangcheng back and put him in jail by catching him from beijing - and also tried to accuse him of illegally providing the state 's confidential information . 
but you nevertheless went on to employ outrageous measures - - arresting chen guangcheng and bringing him back from beijing to be held prisoner , then attempting to have him found guilty of illegally revealing state secrets . 
however , you took further absurd actions - catching chen guangcheng in beijing and bringing him back . you also implicated him in the crime of illegally providing national confidential information . 
你 不 觉得 这个 罪名 对于 一个 生活 在 贫穷 山村 的 双目 失明 的 人 来说 很 荒唐 么 ? 

don 't you think this criminal charge very absurd for a blind person living in a poor mountain village ? 
don 't you think that it is a very absurd accusation for a blind man who lives in a poor mountain village ? 
don 't you find it quite ludicrous to accuse a blind man from a poor mountain village of that crime ? 
don 't you think that this crime is rather absurd for a blind person who lives in a poor mountain village ? 
其实 , 只要 你们 真的 改正 了 错误 , 只要 你们 做 的 很好 , 你们 还 怕 一个 盲人 批评 吗 ? 

in fact , as long as you people have really corrected your mistakes and as long as you people have done a good job , would you be afraid of the criticism by a blind person ? 
in fact , as long as you have truly corrected mistakes , as long as you have done things very well , are you still afraid of the criticism of a blind man ? 
actually , if you had truly corrected your errors , if you had acted correctly , would you fear the criticism of a blind man ? 
actually , you only need to correct your mistakes , you only need to do good . do you really fear the criticism of a blind person ? 
你们 有必要 派 数十 人 一天 24小时 看管 他 甚至 要 气急败坏 地 给 他 定罪 么 ? 

would you people find it necessary to dispatch tens of people to watch him 24 hours a day and even feel so exasperated as to convict him ? 
is it necessary for you to send several dozens of people to watch him 24 hours a day , and even sentence him in a hurried and desperate way ? 
did you have to send several dozen people to keep watch over him twenty-four hours a day and , flustered and exasperated , even have him accused of a crime ? 
do you really have to assign over 10 people to watch over him 24 hours a day and even try to pin utterly preposterous crimes onto him ?

中国 的 法治 虽然 不 完善 , 但 还 不至于 无法无天 . 

although the rule of law in china is imperfect , it is not so bad as to allow lawlessness . 
although china 's legal system is not perfect , at least it has not become absolutely lawless . 
although the rule of law in china may not be perfect , but neither is it at the point of lawlessness .

and although your barbaric execution of the law would have stopped , even if he criticized you , how long could he go on ? 
可是 , 你们 今天 正在 不断 丑化 自己的 形象 ,

but today you are continuously smearing your own image . 
but you are now steadily denigrating your own image . 
instead , today you are continuing to further debase your own image . 
只要 陈光 诚 一天 没有 获得 自由 , 你们 一天 就 不得 安宁 . 

as long as cheng guangcheng is not free , you people will never have peace . 
you won 't be peaceful as long as chen guangcheng has not been set for free for a day . 
until cheng guangcheng obtains his freedom , you will not have a day of peace . 
as long as chen guangcheng does not get freedom , you will not get one day of rest . 
你们 对 他 的 折磨 已经 够了 , 

you people have tortured him enough . 
it is enough for you to make him suffer . 
you have persecuted him enough . 
your torture of him is already enough , 
如果 还 想 给 他 定罪 或者 还 想 采取 进一步 的 流氓 手段 , 我们 决不会 袖手旁观 的 . 

if you even want to convict him or resort to further hooliganism , we will never look on with folded arms . 
we would never stand by and do nothing if you still want to charge him with any crime or use further rogue means . 
if you try to have him convicted of a crime or attempt to use further thuggish tactics , we will not fold our arms and stand by . 
and if you still want to pin a crime on him or still want to utilize further gangster methods , we will definitely not stand to the side and just watch .

苦闷 , 失望 , 无奈 , 甚至 想 过 屈服 , 但 要 过人 的 生活 除了 靠 自己 去 争取 , 还能 指望 谁 呢 . 

depressed , disappointed , helpless , even thinking of submission , but if i want to live a human life , who else can i count on but myself to make it happen ? 
one could feel depressed , hopeless , helpless , and even think of surrendering , but if one wants to live a human life , whom can he depend on except that he himself struggles for it ? 
i agonized , despaired , felt helpless and even thought of succumbing . but if we want to lead a life fit for humans , who can we count on to fight but ourselves ? 
agony , disappointment , helplessness , even thinking of submission ; but to live one 's life , besides fighting yourself , who can you place hope on ? 
尽管 谋事 在 人 , 成事 在 天 , 但 即使 不成 , 如果 我 没 为 自己的 理想 努力 过 , 我 就 会 认为 我自己 有错 , 我 活该 过 狗 一样的 生活 . 

though man proposes , god disposes ; even if i failed ... i would think that it is my fault and that i deserve to live like a dog if i have not tried hard for my own ideals . 
although doing a thing depends on human effort , and success relies on the heavens , i would think i am wrong if i have not made an effort for my own ideal , even though it is not successful , and i deserve to live like a dog . 
man proposes and god disposes . yet even if i failed , i would hold myself to blame and deserve the life of a dog if i did not struggle for my own ideals . 
although the planning of affairs rests with man , to complete affairs rests with heaven . still , even if my plans do not succeed , if i do not work hard towards my ideals i will believe that i myself am wrong and deserve to live the life of a dog . 
为 正义 的 事情 努力 , 本身 就 会 使 自己的 生活 中 增添 一丝 美好 , 至少 在 自己的 心里 , 在 自己 对 自己的 评价 上 . 

the very act of working hard for justice will add some beauty to my own life , at least in my own heart , in my self - appraisal . 
making an effort for a just thing itself can make one 's own life somewhat wonderful , and at least in his heart when he evaluates himself . 
to struggle for something just in itself adds happiness to one 's life , at least in terms of one 's self - judgment in one 's own heart . 
working hard towards righteousness , i will add some beauty to my life in this way alone , at least in my heart and in my appraisal of myself .

因为 世界 的 环境 已经 不能 让 一个 长久 不 经 选举 的 政权 的 存在 了 , 

that 's because the global environment has made it impossible for the existence of a regime that has not held elections for a long time . 
because the environment in the world is no longer allowing a regime that has not been elected to exist for long . 
because the global environment is already such that it will not permit the existence of a regime that has failed to hold elections for so long . 
because the world environment already cannot allow a regime that for a such a long time has not used elections . 
这 不过是 一个 时间 的 问题 .

只是 感叹 中华民族 非常 幸运 , 总是 在 历史 的 拐弯 处 被 世界 级 的 伟人 级 的 恶魔 领 上 一条 敲 你 骨 吸 你 血 的 地狱 之路 , 竟然 有人 将 这 条 路上 的 堆堆 白骨 滩 滩 血迹 叫做 辉煌 , 还 逼 着 我们 为 这样的 辉煌 自豪 . 

i only lament that the chinese people have such luck that at turning points of history , they have always been led by devils of an international and monstrous stature on a road to hell along which your bones are beaten and your blood is sucked out of you . just to think that some people call glorious the bones of the dead and the puddles of blood along this road , and even force us to be proud of such glory . 
what i lament is that the chinese nation is very lucky to be led on the path to hell by a world - class great man and completely exploited from its bone and blood whenever it is at a historical turning point . even if somebody calls piles of white bones and areas of blood stains along the path as brilliances , and forces us to be proud of the brilliances . 
i just sigh that the chinese nation could have been so lucky that , at every turn of history , it could always be led by world - class demons onto a marrow - and - blood - sucking road to hell . some people actually call the heaps of white bones and pools of blood on this road glory and force us to feel proud of such glory . 
it 's just that i sigh that the chinese ethnicity is 'extremely lucky ' , we have always been put on a hellish path of torture and awfulness during the turns of history by world classed and superman classed monsters . even though some call the high piles of bones and pools of blood this path extracts as glorious , and force us to be proud of our gloriousness . 
黑夜 处处 有 , 神州 最 漫长 . 

dark night falls everywhere , but it is the longest in the divine land of china . 
everywhere has a dark night , but the longest one is in shenzhou ( the sacred state ) . 
although darkness exists everywhere , it is at its longest in china . 
dark nights are everywhere , china is endless . 
秦 皇 加 孔 圣 , 人民 猛 遭殃 . 

the qin emperor plus the sage confucius brought huge disasters to people . 
people would suffer a lot when the qin emperor integrated with the confucian sage . 
qin shi huang and confucius caused the people to suffer so much . 
with china 's first emperor qinshihuang and confucius , the people violently died young . 
秦始皇 是 明 着 暴虐 , 孔 圣人 是 阴 着 洗 脑 . 

while the first qin emperor openly ruled as a tyrant , the sage confucius brainwashed in the shadows . 
qin shihuang was an open tyranny and the confucian sage privately washed brains . 
while qin shi huang persecuted openly , confucius brainwashed under the table . 
qinshihuang was openly a tyrant , confucius brain washed covertly . 
中国人 , 不是 不配 民主 , 是 已经 没有 了 民主 的 基因 , 都 被 退化 了 . 

it is not that the chinese people do not deserve democracy , it is that their democracy gene is gone , having been made to regress . 
it is not that chinese people do not deserve to have democracy ; it is because they have not had the democratic gene or their gene has been degenerated . 
it 's not that the chinese do not deserve democracy . it 's that they no longer have democracy in their genes , which have all degenerated . 
it 's not that chinese are not deserving of democracy , it 's that the genes of democracy have already been repressed . 
一个 立国 三千 年 以上 的 国家 , 其 民族文化 如果 有 民主 因子 , 那 这个 国家 早就 民主 了 . 

for a nation that has existed for more than three thousand years , this nation should have long practiced democracy if there was an element of democracy in its national culture . 
a nation that has been established for more than three thousand years , it might have had democracy a long time ago if its national culture contained democratic elements . 
a country with a history of over 3,000 years would have become democratic long ago if its national culture had a component for democracy . 
for a nation that has been around for three thousand years , if its ethnic culture had democratic genes , then this nation would have much earlier become a democracy . 
雅典 建立 民主 制度 的 时候 , 罗马 成立 共和国 的 时候 , 英国人 通过 大 宪章 的 时候 , 法国人 发表 人权 宣言 的 时候 , 美国人 发表 独立 宣言 的 时候 , 中国人 在 干什么 ? 

when a democratic system was established in athens , when a republic was founded in rome , when the magna carta was approved by the british people , when the french people were issuing the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen , and when americans were issuing the declaration of independence , what were chinese people doing ?

蒙古人 入主 中原 前 , 有 忽 里 勒 台 推选 君主 , 满洲 人 早期 有 议政 王 大臣 会议 民主 议政 , 为什么 到 了 汉族 地区 统统 告吹 ? 

before the mongols took control of the central plains , khuriltai were used to elect emperors . the manchus long ago had the council of princes and ministers to practice democratic administration . why did it all evaporate once they came to the region of the han people ? 
mongolians had a kurultai system for selection of their king before they entered into zhong yuan ; manchurians in their early time had a ministers council of the prince regent for democratic consultation . why were those systems all gone when they entered into the han region ? 
before mongolians invaded the central plains , they elected their monarch through the kuraltai . in their early days , manchurians practiced a democratic system of ministerial meetings . why did all these fizzle out in the han regions ? 
before the mongolians came into the central china plains , the mongols elected a leader at the kurultai , the manchurians had democratic discussions of government between the king and ministers , why is it when they came to the han region these tendencies were put out ? 
中国人 追求 物质 资料 , 对 精神 信仰 , 政治权利 毫无 兴趣 .

chinese people pursue materials only and have no interest in spiritual faith and political rights . 
chinese chase material goods and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual belief and political rights . 
the chinese pursue material resources , and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual beliefs and political power . 
不信 , 中国人 要 有 普选 权 , 一个 馅饼 就 可以 卖给 你 . 

believe it or not , at the price of a stuffed pancake , chinese people would sell you their universal suffrage if they had it . 
if you do not believe it , as long as a chinese person has an election right , he can sell it to you for a meat pancake . 
you don 't believe it ? if the chinese were given universal suffrage , they would sell it to you for a single pie . 
i don 't believe it . if chinese had universal suffrage , they 'd sell it for a salty pancake . 
五十万 年后 , 如果 中国人 要 民主 , 那 一定 是 要 地震 , 能 跑 就 跑 吧 ! 

after half a million years , if the chinese want democracy , the earthquake will surely be coming . run if you can ! 
500,000 years later , if chinese people want democracy , there must be an earthquake coming . if you can run , please do it ! 
five hundred thousand years later , it would need an earthquake for the chinese to want democracy . so run while you can ! 
500,000 years later , if the chinese want democracy , then there will certainly need to be an earthquake ; those who can run , run !

china should also create a good environment for negotiations on the tibetan issue instead of suppressing the dalai lama unrelentingly . 
and china should also create a good environment for negotiation of the tibetan issue , and should not suppress the dalai lama all the time . 
in order to create a favorable negotiating environment on the tibetan issue , china should refrain from blindly pressuring the dalai lama . 
and china should also create a good environment for the tibet problem , and not just attack the dali lama . 
他 说 , 达赖喇嘛 不 要求 西藏 独立 , 西藏 还是 中国 的 一 部份 , 但是 中国政府 必须 保存 西藏 独特 的 文化 , & quot ; 让 西藏 人 有 真正 的 自治 & quot ; . 

he said that the dalai lama does not demand independence for tibet . tibet is still part of china , but the chinese government must preserve tibet 's unique culture so that " tibetans will have genuine autonomy . "

besides this , kelsang gyaltsen pointed out that some chinese think that once the dali lama dies , the tibet problem will disappear . 
他 说 这个 想法 是 非常 危险 的 , 因为 一旦 达赖喇嘛 不在 , 中国 就 失去 了 一个 解决 西藏 问题 的 历史性 机会 . 

he said that this idea is very dangerous because china will lose a historic opportunity to solve the tibetan issue once the dalai lama passes away . 
he said that this view is very dangerous , because once the dalai lama is gone , china would lose the historical opportunity to solve the tibetan issue .

我们 先 看看 中国 的 古代 , 

let 's take a look first at ancient china . 
let 's see china 's ancient times . 
let 's first take a look at antiquity in china . 
first let us look at ancient china . 
大家 知道 , 中国 自 秦始皇 构建 了 大一统 的 中央集权 制 , 其后 的 任何 朝代 都 在 这一 政治 框架 下 运行 , 

everybody knows that beginning with the first qin emperor , china has constructed a large and unified centralized power system , with all dynasties that followed operating under this political framework . 
everyone knows that since qin shihuang established the universally unified and centralized power system in china , any subsequent dynasties were operated under the political framework . 
everybody knows that in china , starting with the united centralized rule built by qin shi huang , all subsequent dynasties operated according to this political framework . 
everybody knows that china has been a centralized power since the first emperor , qinshihuang , established a unified china . after that all dynasties operated under this governmental framework . 
虽然 汉代 曾经 暂时 施行 了 & quot ; 双轨制 & quot ; , 也就是 分封制 与 中央集权 制 双重 制度 并行 的 政治制度 , 最后 还是 以 中央集权 制 收尾 , 

although a " double - track system " was temporarily implemented in the han dynasty , that is , a political system consisting of a dual coexisting feudal system and centralized power system , after all , there was still a centralized power system in the end . 
although the han dynasty temporarily implemented a " two - track system , " i.e. a political system that practiced the feudal system and centralized power system at the same time , it eventually switched to a complete centralized power system in the end . 
although the han dynasty temporarily implemented a " dual system " ; that is , political system in which feudalism and centralism operated in parallel ; it finally ended up employing centralism . 
although in the han period they implemented a " two track system " for a short time , it was just a governmental system of simultaneous operation of feudalist and central power mechanisms , and in the end central power won out . 
这种 中央集权 制 的 结果 在 当时 的 历史 条件 下 有 其 先进 的 一面 , 有 其 促进 生产力 发展 的 一方 , 

the effect of this kind of centralized power system under the conditions at that time in history had its progressive side , had its aspect of promoting the development of forces of production . 
the outcome of this kind of centralized power system had an advanced aspect in the historical condition by then , which promoted the development of productivity . 
under the historical conditions of that time , this kind of centralism had facets that were advanced or that promoted productivity and development . 
the results of this type of central power system had its progressive side under the historic conditions of the time , and promoted the development of production capability . 
但 我们 也 应该 看到 这种 制度 二千 余年 长期 运作 的 结果 导致 了 地方 缺乏 应有 的 创造力 , 主动性 和 积极性 , 更 无法 因地制宜 地 制定 适合 本地 发展 的 各项 制度 政策 . 

however , we should also see that the prolonged period of more than 2,000 years of running this system resulted in a lack of creativity , initiative , and activity in local areas , making it even less possible to formulate , based on local conditions , various kinds of regulations and policies appropriate for local development . 
but we should also see that the long - term operation of the system for more than 2,000 years had made local administrations lacking of their creativities , initiatives , and enthusiasms , and unable to make various suitable systems and policies for local developments based on local circumstances . 
but we should also observe that more than two thousand years of this kind of system resulted in localities that lacked the creativity , initiative and motivation that they should have . furthermore , it was impossible to tailor - make systems and policies so that they suited local development . 
however , we should see that the results of over two thousand years of operating under this system has lead to locations lacking the ingenuity , initiative , and pro - activeness they should have ; and in no way could that system set various governing policies suitable for local development with actions that suit local situations . 
金字塔 似的 统治 制度 也 造成 了 下级 官员 只能 往 上 看 , 处处 听命于 上 一级 , 

the pyramid - like system of government also caused lower - level officials to only look upward , following every detail of orders from higher levels . 
the pyramid type of ruling system had made lower - class officials looking upward only and following directions from their superiors for everything . 
a pyramid - shaped system of political rule also made it so that lower - level officials could only fix their gazes upward and in every regard take orders from their immediate superiors . 
a pyramid - like governing system also led to lower level officials only looking upward , in all respects taking orders from the next higher level . 
因为 县府 的 地方 官员 皆 为 中央政府 任命 , 没有 任何 协调 和 谈判 的 余地 , 更 别提 那些 一般 的 老百姓 了 , 

since all local officials in the county government were appointed by the central government , they had no room for coordination and negotiation among themselves , let alone with those ordinary citizens . 
there was no room for coordination and negotiation because even local officials at the county level were appointed by the central government , not to mention those common people . 
because the local county officials were all appointed by the central government , there was no room for coordination or negotiation between them , let alone with the common people . 
because the local officials of county seats were all appointed by the central government , there was no space for concessions and negotiations , and don 't even bother to bring up the common people . 
当 古代 中国 农民 的 权利 受到 侵害 时 , 他们 只能 一 忍 再 忍 , 

when their rights were infringed upon , peasants in ancient china could do nothing but put up with it time and again . 
when rights of farmers were infringed upon in ancient china , they could only bear it time and again . 
when the rights of peasants in ancient china were infringed upon , they could only grin and bear it . 
when the rights of ancient chinese farmers were encroached on , they could only endure it . 
只有 到 最 基本 的 权利 受到 威胁 时 , 也就是 大面积 的 饥饿 , 因 暴政 , 因 自然灾害 而 导致 生命 权 被 剥夺 时 , 才 会 揭 杆 而 起 , 

only when their most basic rights were threatened , that is , when their rights of existence were deprived by widespread famine , tyranny , and natural disasters , would they rise in revolt with sharpened sticks . 
only when their basest rights were threatened , i.e. when a famine spread in big areas , a tyrannical rule or natural disaster caused loss of their living rights , would they rebel . 
it was only when their most basic rights were threatened , such as by large scale famine , or when their right to life was being deprived due to tyranny or natural calamity , that they would rise in rebellion . 
only when their most basic rights were threatened - that is large scale starvation and the right of life being exploited by cruel government or natural disasters - would they raise up flags and resist . 
二千 年来 多次 风起云涌 的 农民起义 袭 遍 全国 , 从没 有预谋 的 陈胜 吴广 到 有计划 的 黄巾起义 , 再 至 唐代 的 黄巢 暴动 , 还有 李自成 因 起义 而 获得 一个 月 的 王朝 统治 , 除 朱元璋 外 都 没有 取得 真正 意义 上 的 胜利 , 

over 2,000 years , several peasant uprisings spread like storms across the country , from the spontaneous chen sheng wu guang uprising to the plotted yellow turban uprising , to the huang chao riot in the tang dynasty , as well as the one - month dynastic rule as a result of li zicheng 's uprising . except for zhu yuanzhang , none achieved victory in the true sense of the word . 
in more than 2,000 years , many peasant uprisings spread everywhere in the country like storms , but they never won a victory in a real sense except zhu yuanzhang , from chen sheng , and wu guang , who did not plan their uprising to the planned huang jin insurrection , from the huang chao revolt in the tang dynasty to the li zhicheng rebellion that established a dynasty for only a month . 
in two thousand years , several turbulent peasant uprisings have swept across the entire country : from the unplanned chen sheng and wu guang uprising to the preplanned yellow turban rebellion , and then to the huang chao rebellion in the tang dynasty and li zicheng , who was able to rule as emperor for a month as the result of an uprising . besides zhu yuanzhang , none of the rebellions obtained a truly meaningful victory . 
over two thousand years numerous peasant rebellions have swept across the nation ; from ones that had no forethought such as that led by chen sheng and wu guang to the planned yellow turban uprising , and again the huangchao violence of the tang dynasty , and the li zicheng uprising that ruled as a dynasty for one month . except for zhu yuanzhang , all of these did not gain victory in the true meaning . 
即使 这样 以 朱元璋 开创 的 明 王朝 也 不过是 其它 朝代 的 更替 轮回 , 并 没有 制度 上 的 变化 . 

even the ming dynasty established this way by zhu yuanzhang was still nothing but a rotating replacement of other dynasties , with no change in the system . 
even the ming dynasty created by zhu yuanzhang was only a cycle of other dynasties , and there were no systematic changes . 
even the ming dynasty that zhu yuanzhang initiated was nothing more than the reincarnation of previous dynasties , with no change in political institutions . 
even the ming dynasty established by zhu yuanzhang was no more than the replacing of one dynasty with another , and there weren 't changes in the system of government . 
平民 出身 也 没有 多少 文化 的 朱元璋 把 中国 的 古代 的 集权制 玩 到 了 病态 , 玩 到 了 极限 , 从此 失去 了 唐代 那种 开放 自由 宽容 的 生龙活虎 的 局面 , 变得 死气沉沉 , 

born a commoner with little education , zhu yuanzhang implemented ancient china 's centralized power system to a sickening extreme . the brimming vitality characteristic of the tang dynasty , born of openness , freedom , and tolerance , was replaced by stagnant lifelessness . 
zhu yuanzhang , who came from a common family and did not receive much education , played the chinese ancient centralized power system to a sick extent , and to extremes . since then , the vigorous state of the type of the tang dynasty that was open , free , and tolerant , had become depressed . 
zhu yuanzhang , born a commoner and uncultured for the most part , manipulated china 's ancient centralized system with a perverse relish , taking it to its extreme limits . the vigor of the tang dynasty , characterized by openness , freedom and tolerance , was lost and replaced by a deathly spiritlessness . 
zhu yuanzhang , who was born a commoner and did not have much culture , took china 's ancient centralized power system to an abnormal and extreme state , therein losing the vigorous and vital aspects of freedom and tolerance of the tang dynasty that system enjoyed , making the system inert . 
言论 自由 的 空气 一度 在 中国 大地 上 消失 , 

the free speech atmosphere vanished from the land of china for some time . 
the atmosphere of freedom of speech disappeared in the vast land of china for a time . 
all at once , the atmosphere of free speech disappeared from china 's vast area . 
any room for discussions of freedom disappeared on the chinese mainland , 
人性 受到 最大 的 压制 , 

human nature suffered utmost suppression . 
human nature was suppressed to the maximum extent . 
human nature was suppressed to the highest degree . 
the nature of humanity received the greatest suppression , 
人人 变得 谨小慎微 , 诚惶诚恐 , 不敢 多 言 , 

everyone became overcautious and dared not talk too much , from fear and trepidation . 
everybody became very cautious and dared not to say more words with reverence and awe . 
people became timorous , extremely afraid , and unwilling to say too much . 
and everyone became overcautious , in awe and reverence of the government , and did not dare to say too much . 
这是 二千 年来 唯一 农民起义 取胜 的 后果 , 一度 让 中国人 变得 人 不 人 鬼不鬼 . 

the result of this sole successful peasant uprising over 2,000 years turned the chinese people into subhuman beings for a period of time . 
this was the only outcome of peasant uprisings in 2,000 years , and it made chinese people neither humans nor ghosts . 
this was the outcome of the only peasant uprising to succeed in two thousand years : in one go it turned the chinese people into the living dead . 
this was the aftermath of the only peasant rebellion that was successful in two thousand years , leaving the chinese people with a meager existence for a time . 
现在 我们 再 看看 西欧 被 称之为 黑暗 时代 的 中世纪 , 

now let 's take a look at the middle ages in western europe , known as the dark ages . 
let 's see the medieval ages of the so - called dark time in western europe . 
now let 's look at western europe 's medieval period , which has been called the dark ages . 
now let 's look at the middle ages that are called the dark ages in western europe . 
西欧 中世纪 是 在 西罗马 被 游牧民族 摧毁 之后 形成 的 与 过去 古希腊 古罗马 毫不相干 历经 千年 的 时代 , 

the middle ages in western europe was a period of one thousand years which came about after western rome was destroyed by nomads and had nothing to do with the previous ancient greece and rome . 
the medieval ages of western europe were formed after the western rome was destroyed by nomadic nations , and lasted for a thousand years . they had nothing to do with the ancient greece and rome of the past . 
the middle ages in western europe was a thousand year period that occurred after nomadic peoples destroyed western rome and that did not have the slightest connection to ancient greece and ancient rome . 
western europe 's middle ages was a thousand year era that took shape after western rome was destroyed by nomadic peoples . these middle ages had no connection to ancient greece and rome . 
这个 时代 是 以 分封 为 特征 , 也就是 分封 土地 , 

this period was characterized by fiefdoms , namely land fiefdoms . 
those ages featured the feudal system , i.e. land holding . 
this period was characterized by feudalism ; that is , the granting of feudal land titles . 
this era 's main characteristic was feudalism , that is dividing up lands ; 
层层 下 分 的 土地 领主 拥有 更多 的 自主 权力 , 

landlords at lower levels had more independent power . 
many layers of land feudal lords , from the top to the bottom , had more autonomy . 
as titles were subdivided into increasingly lower strata , the lords at each lower stratum possessed an increased amount of autonomy . 
land was divided up further and further among lords and the lower levels had more self - governing rights . 
无论 方圆 几 公里 的 小小的 封建主 , 还是 能 上 台面 的 公 候 伯 子 男 贵族 , 由于 上 与 下 , 左 与 右 能够 相互 制衡 , 相互 制约 , 相互 依赖 , 有条件 有能力 与 国王 争取 自己 应有 的 权利 , 就 产生 了 中国 古代 从未有过 的 贵族 与 国王 坐 在 一起 为了 各自 的 利益 而 进行 谈判 的 情景 , 

whether they were small feudal lords with territories extending a few kilometers or the nobility of dukes , marquises , counts , viscounts , and barons who appeared on formal occasions , as people of various ranks were able to mutually check and balance and depend on one another , with the conditions and abilities to fight for their legitimate rights from the king , there were scenes of kings and noblemen sitting together for negotiations of their own respective interests , scenes never s 
no matter whether small feudal lords who had an area of several square kilometers , or nobles who had titles of duke , marquis , count , viscount , and baron , since superiors and inferiors , and the left and right , could balance , restrain , and were interdependent with each other , and had their prerequisites and capabilities to strive for their own rights against kings , the scenes in which nobles sat with a king negotiating for their own interest emerged , which never happened in china 's 
because they were capable of balancing , restricting and depending on each other both vertically and horizontally , even feudal lords with a few square kilometers of land as well as the dukes , marquises , earls , viscounts and barons that came to power possessed the conditions and clout to win from the king the rights that were rightfully theirs , thereby producing a situation where aristocrats and the king sat together to negotiate for their respective benefit , a situation that has ne 
no matter if one was a small feudal lord of a few square kilometers of land , or a male aristocrat with a royal title ; because those higher and lower could mutually balance , restrict , and rely on each other , they had the conditions and ability to strive for the rights they should have from their king . this produced the situation of kings and aristocrats sitting together and carrying out negotiations for each one 's benefits that was never seen in ancient china . 
相互 妥协 让步 , 而不是 用 暴力 手段 打倒 取代 对方 , 

they made mutual compromises and concessions instead of overthrowing or superseding other parties by using force . 
compromises and concessions were made mutually instead use of violent means to knock down or replace opponents . 
that is , mutual accommodation and concession , and not the use of violent methods to beat down and replace the other party . 
they made mutual concessions , and did not use violent methods to beat down and replace opponents . 
这样 通过 制定 各种 契约 , 权利 不断 下 放到 贵族 和 平民 手中 , 贵族 和 平民 的 权力 越来越 多 , 国王 的 权利 越来越 小 , 

this way , by means of various kinds of contracts , rights were continuously granted to noblemen and commoners , and with increasing power for noblemen and commoners , the king 's rights became increasingly diminished . 
in this way , through making various contracts , rights were continuously transferred to nobles and common people , and they had more and more rights , and kings had fewer and fewer . 
in this way , with the drawing up various agreements , power steadily moved down into the hands of aristocrats and commoners . the power of the aristocrats and commoners gradually increased while the king 's power progressively decreased . 
in this way , by setting various contracts , power continuously was released into the hands of aristocrats and commoners , the rights of aristocrats and commoners became greater and greater , and the power of the king lesser and lesser . 
只 到 后来 的 英女王 只 处于 摆放 的 地位 , 而 没有 任何 实际 的 权力 . 

in the end , the british queen became only ceremonial , with no actual power . 
later , the british queen had only a status for display , and not any substantial power . 
by the time the queen of england came along , she only occupied a passive position and did not have any real power . 
until finally the english queen was just a empty position , and did not have any real power . 
民主 就是 这样 逐渐 实现 的 ! 

democracy was gradually realized through this method ! 
democracy was gradually realized in this way ! 
this is how democracy was gradually achieved ! 
democracy was gradually realized in this way ! 
再 回 过头 来 比较 比较 , 一切 权力 集中 在 皇帝 手中 ( 除 李世民 外 ) 也 几乎 没有 贵族 的 中国 古代 , 农民 是 很难 与 之 坐 在 谈判 桌上 一 壶 茶 , 一 杯 酒 , 在 轻松 愉快 中 相互 妥协 让步 , 制定 双方 都 满意 的 契约 的 , 

let 's come back to make a comparison with ancient china , with all power centralized in the hands of the emperor ( except for li shimin ) and with almost no noblemen . it would be hard for peasants to sit with the king at the negotiating table over a cup of tea and a glass of wine , making mutual compromises and concessions in a relaxed and pleasant manner and formulating contracts to the satisfaction of the two sides . 
let 's come back again to compare with ancient china , where every power was concentrated in the hands of emperors ( except li shimin ) , and there were almost no nobles . it was very difficult for peasants to be able to sit in front of a negotiation table , joyfully making compromises and concessions on a contract agreed to by both sides while enjoying a cup of tea or a glass of wine . 
let 's take another look back in order to make a comparison . in ancient china , with all power concentrated in the hand of the emperor ( with the exception of li shimin ) and almost no aristocracy , it was almost impossible for peasants to sit with the emperor over a pot of tea or a glass of wine and light - heartedly make mutual compromises and concessions or formulate agreements that satisfied both sides . 
now look back and compare , in ancient china , where all power was concentrated in the hands of the emperor ( except for li shimin of the tang dynasty ) with almost no aristocrats , peasants could not easily enjoy a kettle of tea or cup of wine with them at the negotiating table , and mutually compromise in a relaxed and happy way to set up contracts with both sides happy . 
在 这种 情况 下 , 当 生命 权 被 剥夺 时 , 只能 采取 暴力 的 手段 推翻 现在 的 王朝 , 试图 取而代之 , 

under such circumstances , when the right of existence was deprived , the only way remaining was to overthrow the existing dynasty by force and try to replace it . 
under this circumstance , when the living right was taken away , only violent means could overthrow an existing dynasty and try to replace it . 
under such circumstances , when they were being deprived of their right to life , they had no choice but to adopt violent methods to overthrow the current dynasty in an attempt to supplant it . 
under this situation , when the right to life was being exploited , they could only take up violent methods to topple the current dynasty , aiming to replace them . 
其 结果 是 反复 轮回 , 由 唐代 顶峰 走向 了 明朝 的 病态 . 

consequently , there was a repeated rotation , from the heyday of the tang dynasty to the morbidity of the ming dynasty . 
its outcome was the repeated cycle from the peak of the tang dynasty to the sick status of the ming dynasty . 
this outcome repeated itself again and again , from the high point of the tang dynasty to the morbidity of the ming dynasty . 
the result was successive dynasties , from the high point of the tang dynasty to the abnormal situation of the ming dynasty . 
比较 中西 历史 , 我们 发现 似乎 没有 一个 西方 国家 的 古代 与 中国 古代 的 统治者 与 被统治者 的 矛盾 会 如此 激化 , 

comparing chinese history with western history , we find there seems to be no western country where conflict between the ruler and the ruled was as aggravated as it was in ancient china . 
comparing histories between china and the west , we discovered that the contradictions between rulers and the ruled in ancient china were much more intensified than those in ancient western countries . 
if we compare european and chinese history , we discover that there is practically no western country with an ancient period where the contradictions between the rulers and the ruled were as sharp as in china . 
comparing chinese and western history , we learn there seems to be not one western country who in ancient times had such intensified contradictions between those in power and those ruled over as in china . 
没有 一个 西方 国家 像 中国 古代 那样 农民起义 层出不穷 , 

in no western country were peasant uprisings as frequent as in ancient china . 
no western countries had so many continuous peasant uprisings as ancient china had . 
there is no western country that experienced an endless succession of peasant uprisings like china did . 
there is not one western country that was like ancient china and had endless peasant uprisings . 
西方 国家 古代 王室 和 农民 当 矛盾 升起 时 , 贵族 和 平民 为了 诉求 自己的 利益 首先 想到 的 是 通过 谈判 方式 得到 解决 , 并 做 些 相互 的 让步 逐渐 获得 更多 的 权利 , 而 鲜有 采取 暴力 的 方式 . 

in western countries , when conflicts between ancient royal households and peasants arose , noblemen and commoners would first think of achieving resolution through negotiations to protect their own interests . they would make some mutual concessions to gradually win more rights , while force was rarely used . 
in the western countries , when differences between ancient royal families and peasants emerged , what nobles and common people thought of first was to settle them through a negotiation path , to obtain more rights gradually by making mutual concessions , and they seldom used violent means . 
when contradictions arose between the royal house and the peasants in the ancient history of western countries , the first thing that aristocrats and commoners thought of when they were making an appeal for their own interests was to reach a solution through negotiation and make mutual concessions in order to gradually obtain greater benefits . rarely did they employ violent methods . 
in western countries , when the ancient royal households and peasants had contradictions , the aristocrats and commoners appealing for their own benefits thought first to reach resolutions through the method of negotiations , and made some mutual concessions to gradually gain more rights . only rarely did they take up the method of violence . 
明白 于 此 , 当 进入 二十一世纪 时 , 网络 上 依然 还 会 看到 有些 民主 逗 士 由于 受到 明代 超级 绝对 极权 制 思想 的 遗传 , 

understanding this , you will see that even as we enter the 21st century , some democratic " fighters " on the internet , having inherited the idea of the ultra , absolute totalitarian system of the ming dynasty , 
understanding this , when we enter into the 21st century , we can still see those democratic warriors in networks who have inherited the ideology of the absolute power concentration system of the ming dynasty , 
understanding this , as we enter the 21st century , we can still see on the internet that there are some democracy militants who , having inherited the ultra - absolute totalitarian thinking of the ming dynasty , 
understanding from this , now that we have entered the 21st century , on the internet one can still see some fighters of democracy that have received the heritage of utterly absolutist totalitarianism thinking from the ming dynasty . 
也 由于 文革 毒素 侵蚀 着 它们 的 肌体 , 这些 民主 逗 士 除了 打倒 , 推翻 就 不会 说 别的 . 

and also because their bodies are eroded by the poison of the cultural revolution , these democratic " fighters " can talk about nothing except annihilation and overthrow . 
and have been poisoned by the virus of the cultural revolution that they can say nothing except those words of " down with or overthrow something . " 
and whose bodies have been invaded by the poison of the cultural revolution , are incapable as democratic warriors of talking about anything but " overthrow " and " toppling " . 
also because the poison of the cultural revolution has infested their bodies , these fighters of democracy only talk about overthrowing and toppling and nothing else . 
而 这种 观念 才是 民主 最大 的 障碍 , 因为 这些 人 不 懂得 谈判 协调 妥协 是 实现 民主 最 重要 的 手段 和 途径 . 

yet it is this kind of ideology that is the largest obstacle to democracy , because these people don 't understand that negotiation , consultation , and compromise are the most important methods and approaches for realizing democracy . 
and those concepts are the biggest barrier to democracy , because those people do not understand that negotiation , coordination , and compromise are the most important means and path for realization of democracy . 
but this kind of thinking is the greatest barrier to democracy , because these people do not understand that negotiation and cooperation are the most important means and channel to realizing democracy . 
these ideas are the biggest obstacles to democracy , because these people do not understand that negotiations and concessions are the most important method on the road to realizing democracy .

the author was lucky to spend this year 's spring festival in a rural area of the mainland , and visited some relatives and friends . 
during this year 's spring festival , i was fortunate enough to spend the new year in the countryside visiting some family and friends . 
this spring festival , the author was lucky to go to a mainland village for the chinese new year and visit some relatives and friends . 
在 为 中国 农村 浓浓 的 年 味 所 感染 的 同时 , 也 为 农村 枯燥 的 文化 活动 而 担忧 . 

while impressed by the rich festive atmosphere in rural china , i was also concerned with the drab cultural activities in the countryside . 
i was not only influenced by the dense atmosphere of the festival in the chinese rural area , but also concerned about those boring cultural activities there . 
while being caught up in the rich new year 's atmosphere in china 's countryside , i also became worried about the lack of interesting cultural activities in rural areas . 
while infected with the thick atmosphere of the new year of china 's villages , i was uneasy about the lake of cultural activities in the villages . 
笔者 在 一个 亲友 的 村里 发现 , 往年 这个 村 每逢 春节 , 都要 自发 组织 村民 玩 一个 叫 & quot ; 走马灯 & quot ; 的 地 戏 , 

this writer found in one village with friends and relatives that previously at spring festival each year , this village would spontaneously organize villagers to put on a local theatrical show called " revolving lantern . " 
the author discovered in a village where my relatives lived that this village organized villagers spontaneously to play a drama called " trotting horse lamp " for every spring festival in the past . 
i discovered in a friend 's village that in past years the village would set out on its own each spring festival to organize the villagers in putting on a local play called " the galloping horse lantern " . 
the author discovered in the village of a close friend and relative that in past years whenever this village celebrated spring festival , they would organize the villagers and put on a local play called " horse racing lantern , " 
这个 戏 是 以 三国 人物 为 题材 的 , 大人 小孩 都 可以 在 戏 里 担当 角色 , 村民 百 看 不厌 , 

both adults and children could play roles in this show based on characters in the three warring kingdoms . the villagers never grew tired of watching it . 
the drama is based on figures in the story of the three kingdoms . any adult or child could play a role in the drama , and villagers were not bored at all to watch it a hundred times . 
the play takes as its subject the characters from the three kingdoms . adults and children can all enact a role in the play . the villagers never tire of watching . 
this play uses characters from the three kingdoms period as its theme . adults and children can all play a part in the game and the villagers never get tired of it . 
全 乡 这样的 & quot ; 走马灯 & quot ; 表演 队 有 好几 支 , 不但 在 本 村 玩 , 还要 到 别的 村 去 遛遛 , 你 来 我 往 很 是 热闹 . 

there were several performing teams for " revolving lantern " across the township . they not only performed in their own villages but also visited other villages , creating liveliness through their exchanges . 
there were several of this kind of performance teams of " trotting horse lamp " in the whole township . they performed not only in their own villages , but also went to other villages for visits , and exchanged frequently . 
in this way , there are several " galloping horse lantern " performance troupes throughout the county . they perform not only in their own village , but also travel to other villages , with the exchange between villages becoming very lively . 
this countryside has many troupes that performed " horse racing lantern , " they would not only play in that village but also stroll to other villages ; with these troupes coming and going , everything was quite lively . 
可 今年 这个 村 却 没有 再 组织 了 , 

however , this year this village no longer organized it . 
but this village did not organize the performance this year . 
but this year the village did not organize a troupe . 
but this year this village did not organize the play . 
原来 光 置办 & quot ; 走马灯 & quot ; 的 戏 服 就要 花 上 一大笔 钱 , 以前 是 村民 凑钱 买 的 , 而 这 套 戏 服 现在 已经 破 的 不能 再 穿 了 , 

it turned out that a large sum of money was needed for purchasing costumes alone for " revolving lantern . " in the past , costumes were bought through fund raising among the villagers , yet they are now too worn out to wear . 
the reason is that just the costumes for " trotting horse lamp " would cost a lot , which were bought in the past through donations from villagers . now they are too worn out to be taken on . 
, it seems that it took a lot of money just to buy the costumes for " the galloping horse lantern " . in the past , the villagers would each contribute some cash , but now the costumes are tattered to the point that they can no longer be worn . 
it turns out that just purchasing a costume for " horse racing lantern " costs a large amount of money . in the past villagers would put together their money to buy costumes , and now these costumes are worn out to where they cannot be worn again . 
挨家挨户 再 要 村民 出钱 , 大伙 都 不 愿意 了 , 而 全 乡 其他 几个 村 也 出现 了 类似 的 情况 , 

asking villagers door to door for money again , nobody wanted to do it . similar situations also occurred in several other villages across the township . 
nobody was willing to donate any more , if asking villagers for donations household by household . other villages in the township had a similar situation . 
a house - to - house appeal was made to the villagers to again fork out money , but none was willing . a similar situation has arisen in other villages throughout the county . 
the troupes went door to door asking villagers for a little money , but none of the folks were willing to give anything , and other villages of that countryside also had similar situations . 
没有 了 & quot ; 走马灯 & quot ; , 村里 一下子 冷清 起来 , 

without the " revolving lantern , " the village suddenly became cold and cheerless . 
the village suddenly became quiet without the " trotting horse lamp . " 
without the " galloping horse lantern " , the village has suddenly become cold and cheerless . 
without " horse racing lantern , " the village became cold and quiet all of a sudden ; 
大人 打起 麻 将来 ,

小孩 也 玩 起 了 纸牌 , 

children also started to play poker .

村民 都 说 这个 年 过 的 没劲 . 

villagers all said there was nothing going on for this new year festival . 
villagers said that this festival had no fun . 
the villagers all say that this new year 's was dull . 
and all the villagers said this new year was boring . 
除了 放 鞭炮 , 就是 打麻将 , 也 成了 农村 过年 一 大 景观 , 

setting off firecrackers or playing mahjong has now become one of the major features of the new year celebration in rural areas . 
the big scene in the countryside is either shooting off fireworks or playing mahjong during the festival . 
other than setting off firecrackers , everybody just played mahjong and that became the general backdrop of chinese new year in the countryside . 
setting off firecrackers and playing mahjong became the main scenes in the villages celebrating chinese new year . 
而 赌博 之 风 也 屡 禁 不止 , 并 有 蔓延 的 趋势 , 一场 下来 赢 输 竟 达 上 万元 变得 司空见惯 , 特别是 大批 在外 务工 的 返乡 农民 也 成为 赌场 的 主角 , 

meanwhile , gambling persists in spite of numerous bans and is tending to spread further . winning or losing as much as 10,000 yuan in a single game has even become commonplace . in particular , a large number of peasants returning from their migrant jobs outside have become major players at gambling houses . 
the gambling trend cannot be stopped even though it is prohibited time and again , and is spread even further . gambling for up to ten thousand yuan has become a routine game . especially , big batches of those migrant farmer workers who come back to their hometowns from other areas have played major roles in gambling sites . 
in addition , repeated bans have failed to halt a gambling craze that is showing a tendency to spread . games involving upwards of ten thousand yuan have become a common occurrence , with the large number of returning migrant workers playing a particularly important role in many games . 
the tendency of gambling is incessant despite repeated prohibitions , and tends to spread rampantly . seeing losses and wins reaching over 10,000 rmb has become a common thing , especially for the large number of farmers returning from jobs in away from the countryside , they have become the main characters seen at gambling halls . 
一 年 在外 挣 的 辛苦 钱 就 这样 打 了 水 漂 , 

their money earned by their own sweat over a whole year thereby goes down the drain . 
their hard - earned money from working in other areas for a year is lost in this way . 
in this way , money earned from a year of hard work is squandered . 
the hard earned money from a year of work skips away so easily , 
而 因为 赌博 引起 的 家庭 纠纷 也 时 有 发生 , 有 的 甚至 酿成 家破人亡 的 悲剧 . 

in addition , gambling - related family disputes frequently occur . some even lead to tragedies of divorce and death . 
family disputes occurred time and again because of gambling , which sometimes causes tragedies with families broken up and decimated . 
also , family squabbles stemming from gambling sometimes occur . some even descend into tragedies where families are split or life is lost . 
and family disputes brought about by gambling break out frequently ; some even become tragedies with families falling apart or people dying . 
一些 农民 说 , 不但 过年 赌钱 , 平时 农闲 时 也 经常 参与 赌博 , 

some peasants say they gamble not only during the new year festival , but also frequently participate in gambling during the slack season . 
some farmers said that they gambled not only during festivals but also participated in gambling frequently in slack seasons . 
some farmers say that they gamble not only during the spring festival , but also often during the slack season . 
some farmers say that they not only gamble during the chinese new year , but also participate in gambling when they are not farming ; 
不 赌钱 就 没有 地方 去 , 

there is no place to go if they don 't gamble . 
nowhere to go if they did not gamble . 
if they don 't gamble , they don 't have anywhere to go . 
if you don 't gamble you have no place to go . 
在 农村 想 搞 点 文化 活动 , 找 点 & quot ; 乐 & quot ; 子 太 难 了 , 

it is too difficult to organize some cultural activities , to find some fun in rural areas . 
it is too difficult to organize cultural activities and look for " fun " in the countryside . 
in the countryside , it is too difficult to organize cultural activities or find entertainment . 
if you want to do some cultured activities in the village , finding " entertainment " is too hard ; 
不但 没有 设施 和 经费 , 也 没有人 出面 组织 . 

there are neither facilities nor funds , but also there are no people acting as organizers . 
not only are there no facilities and funding , but also nobody organizes them . 
not only is there a lack of facilities and funds , but also nobody volunteers to handle the organization . 
not only does the village not have facilities and funds , there is no one to organize them . 
而 在 这 方面 , 江西 的 做法 对 农民 来说 无疑 是 福音 , 

however , in this regard , what jiangxi has done is doubtlessly good news for peasants . 
but in this aspect , the practice in jiangxi is definitely good news for farmers . 
in this respect , the method used in jiangxi is doubtlessly welcome news for rural dwellers . 
in this aspect , there is no doubt that the practice of jiangxi province is a happy note for farmers . 
江西省 政府 为 丰富 农民 群众 的 文化 生活 , 不但 从 去年9月 起 实施 & quot ; 政府 出资 , 市场 运作 , 乡镇 搭台 , 农民 看 戏 & quot ; , 

in order to enrich the cultural life of the peasant population , the jiangxi provincial government , starting in september of last year , not only implemented " theatrical performances funded by the government , operated by the market , supported by townships , provided for peasant enjoyment , " 
to enrich the cultural life of the farmer masses , the government of jiangxi province not only implemented the policy that " the government provides funding for it ; the market operates it ; townships build stages ; and farmers watch dramas " last september ,

every year the government arranges at least 60 million rmb of special funds for the villages ' cultural causes , sending excellent cultural products to the masses of the villages . 
新年 伊始 , 又 增加 投入 4000万 元 , 总计 1亿 元 设立 农村 文化 事业 专项 基金 ,

而且 用 这 笔 专项 资金 为 农民 & quot ; 买 & quot ; 的 & quot ; 单 & quot ; 也 相当 实惠 :

and also , what this special funding " paid " toward the farmers ' " bill " is quite a good deal : 
for the rural population , the fruits of this special fund are also very substantial :

从 这 张 & quot ; 购货 清单 & quot ; , 我们 不难看 出 , 政府 并不是 掏钱 了 事 , 而是 在 怎么 把 有限 的 资金 用在 刀口 上 , 为 广大 农民 送 上 物 超 所 值 的 文化 大餐 上 煞 费 了 苦心 , 办 了 大 实事 . 

from this " purchase inventory list , " it is easy for us to see that the government is not simply providing funds , but trying its best to think about how to use the limited funding to provide what is most needed and to bring value - added cultural enjoyment for the vast rural population . it has done a real job . 
it is not difficult for us to see from the " purchase list " that the government does not simply pay the bill , but thinks hard how to use the limited funds in the critical area and deliver a cultural banquet that exceeds its money value to the farmer masses , and has done a big substantial thing for them . 
from this " purchase list " , we can easily see that the government has not thrown money at the problem , but rather has expended a lot of energy to use limited funds in an incisive way in order to deliver a cultural feast with good value to the vast rural population . they have performed an important task . 
from this " shopping list " , it 's not hard for us to see that the government is not just putting out a bit of money and that 's it , but is making painstaking efforts to figure out how to use limited funding to give cultural feasts that exceed the expected values for the vast number of farmers . 
现在 , 广大 农民 无不 为 免交 & quot ; 皇粮 国税 & quot ; 而 欢天喜地 , 

currently , the vast numbers of peasants are rejoicing about being exempt from paying grain tax to the government . 
now , a lot of farmers are very happy and joyful for immunity from providing " royal grains and state 's tax . " 
now , not an individual among the vast rural population is not ecstatic about the waiver of the grain tax . 
at present , there is not one of the vast number of farmers who is not ecstatically happy about being exempt from the " state grain tax . " 
如果 政府 都 能 像 江西 那样 , 为 丰富 农民 群众 的 文化 活动 再 & quot ; 买单 & quot ; , 对 农民 来说 , 这 又是 一个 喜从天降 , 

if the government can do what jiangxi did to " foot the bill " for enriching rural people 's cultural activities , it will be another joy from heaven for peasants . 
if every government can pay the " bill " for enriching cultural activities of the farmer masses as jiangxi did , it would be another happy thing falling from the sky for farmers . 
if governments could do like jiangxi and make greater " purchases " to enrich the cultural life of the rural population , it would be another gift from heaven for those living in the countryside , 
if all governments could be like jiangxi 's and " foot the bill " for cultural activities enriching the farmer masses , then this would be another joy for farmers . 
而 这个 & quot ; 喜 & quot ; 不但 能 让 农民 从 麻将 桌上 解脱出来 , 在 文化 活动 中 & quot ; 动 & quot ; 起来 , 也 为 建设 社会主义 新 农村 添 了 砖 加 了 瓦 . 

furthermore , this " joy " will not only get peasants away from the mahjong table but also get them " active " in cultural activities , which helps add contributions to the construction of new socialist rural areas . 
and this " happy thing " can not only liberate farmers from the mahjong table , and make them " active " in cultural activities , but also add bricks and tiles for the construction of the new socialist countryside . 
and this " gift " would not only free the farmers from the mahjong table , the movement in cultural activities would also add another brick in socialist construction of a new countryside . 
this " joy " would not only allow farmers to escape the mahjong table and become involved in cultural activities , it would also add " bricks and tiles " to the construction of socialist new villages .

目前 的 干部 机制 和 反 贪 机制 , 贪官 要 担心 的 是 管 着 他 的 那 几个 有关 官员 , 不是 广大 的 人民群众 . 

with the current cadre mechanism and the anti - corruption mechanism , a corrupt official need only worry about a handful of relevant officials who supervise him rather than the vast majority of the masses . 
what a corrupted official cares about is those several related officials who are his superiors in the current cadre and anti - corruption mechanisms , not the masses of people . 
under the present cadre system and anti - corruption system , what corrupt officials need to be worry about is a few relevant officials overseeing them , not the broad masses of people . 
with the current cadre mechanisms and anti - greed mechanisms , what greedy officials need to worry about is managing those several related officials , and not the multitudes of the people . 
所以 , 一旦 他 觉得 巳 成功 蒙蔽 或 摆平 了 那 几个 可以 左右 他 命运 的 官员 后 , 便 可 放心 大胆 , 为所欲为 地 进行 腐败 敛财 的 伟大 事业 , 可以 无视 近在咫尺 的 人民群众 的 感受 . 

therefore , once he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or balanced those few officials who can control his fate , he will feel safe in carrying out his great cause of corruption and wealth accumulation unscrupulously and at will , disregarding how the people close to him feel . 
thus , once he feels that he has successfully deceived or tamed those several officials who can determine his fate , he would boldly do whatever he likes to conduct his great cause for accumulation of wealth through corruption , and could ignore the feelings of the masses of people that are only a few feet away from them . 
therefore , once they feel that they have successfully hoodwinked or contented those few officials that can determine their fate , they can they feel reassured and unafraid as they carry out their great project of corruptly and illegally collecting wealth while disregarding the feelings of the nearby masses of people . 
thus , as soon as he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or flattened out those several officials that effect his fate , then he can be at ease with his boldness and enjoy a great career of corrupt accumulation of wealth as his heart desires , and ignore the hardships of the masses surrounding him . 
相反 , 手中 无权 的 平头百姓 若 路 见 不平 , 出头 反腐 , 可能 会 招来 极其 残酷 的 打击报复 , 

in contrast , when ordinary people with no power in their hands take the lead in combating corruption at the sight of an injustice , they may likely be met with extremely cruel retaliation and revenge . 
on the contrary , if common people who do not have power in their hands take the initiative to oppose corruption , they might bring extremely brutal strikes and retaliation upon themselves , 
on the contrary , if the common people who don 't hold any power come across an injustice and stand up against corruption , they will possibly provoke an extremely brutal reprisal , 
alternatively , if a ordinary person with no power sees injustice and comes out against corruption , he will likely bring about cruel attacks and retributions to himself , 
或 再 被 扣上 政治 帽子 , 随时 弄到 出师 未 捷 身 先 死 的 地步 . 

or they may be also politically labeled against and may anytime suffer the fate of dying before the battle has won . 
or be imposed with political accusations , and end up with failure before achieving any victory . 
or be branded by the government and end up at any time being crushed in defeat before obtaining any victory . 
or have a political collar placed around his neck , and be put in a position to die at any time before he is victorious . 
两相 比较 : 搞 腐败 的 风险 较低 , 搞 反腐 的 成本 则 反而 较高 . 

comparing the two : those who practice corruption take less risk while those who combat corruption bear the high cost instead . 
compared with the two sides , corrupted individuals have lower risk , but individuals who oppose corruption have to bear a higher cost . 
a comparison of the two : engaging in corruption is relatively risk free , while the cost of resisting corruption on the other hand is high . 
comparing the two : the risk in being corrupt is relatively low , the cost of being anti - corrupt is relatively high .
